# Reads changed-file paths on stdin (one per line) and prints boolean lines in
# GITHUB_OUTPUT form: `code`, `docs`, `agent`, `app`, the six area flags
# `api`, `web`, `portal`, `addins`, `m365`, `rust`, then `topology_browser` and
# `endpoint` (all native endpoint checks; distinct from the narrow QEMU flag) —
# each `true|false`.
#
# A documentation path is docs/**, apps/docs/**, or a *.md / *.mdx file
# anywhere — the exact set `ci.yml` used to `paths-ignore` and `docs-ci.yml`
# used to trigger on. `code=false` means EVERY path is documentation, so the
# code jobs are skipped; `docs=true` means at least one is, so the docs check
# (astro check + build) runs.
#
# `agent=true` gates the Recovery media E2E (QEMU) job: true when a changed
# path is in the job's pinned dependency set (qemu-gate-paths.txt beside this
# script — the two Go commands it builds, their transitive module-internal
# imports, go.mod/go.sum and recovery-media/), OR is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
# itself, OR is this classifier script or that list — each of which can change
# what the job runs without touching agent/ at all.
#
# `app=false` gates the "tooling-only" class: a PR that touches only CI
# plumbing (workflow YAML other than ci.yml, `.github/scripts/**` other than
# this classifier and prepare-ci-apt-sources.mjs, `scripts/release/**`,
# `scripts/security/**` other than check-agent-binary-signatures.sh, and
# `.github/release-provenance/**`) skips the whole app suite (typecheck,
# test-api, test-web, builds, integration, ...). `app` starts false and only
# flips true when a non-docs path falls OUTSIDE that allowlist, so a
# docs-only PR (code=false) also reports app=false — harmless, since
# code=false already skips everything the app gate would. The explicit
# exceptions carve out files the allowlisted directories contain that a
# HEAVY job (not lint/check-migrations/security-audit) actually consumes:
# ci.yml itself; this classifier; prepare-ci-apt-sources.mjs (used by
# rust-check and guided-setup-smoke); check-agent-binary-signatures.sh (used
# by build-agent); verify-release-images.sh (copied and run by
# scripts/smoke-guided-setup.sh inside guided-setup-smoke — an INDIRECT
# consumer, so grep the scripts heavy jobs call, not just ci.yml);
# mobile-native-ci.test.mjs (listed in mobile-native-changes' paths-filter to
# trigger the native iOS build); qemu-gate-paths.txt (its drift test lives in
# agent/cmd/breeze-backup and runs in test-agent, which is app-gated). `.github/actions/**` is deliberately NOT
# allowlisted. Adding a file under an allowlisted directory that a heavy job
# runs? Add its carve-out here AND to the pinned list in the test.
#
# Area outputs (`api`, `web`, `portal`, `addins`, `m365`, `rust`) gate the
# heavy jobs that exercise exactly one application area (test-api,
# integration-test, test-web, the add-in and M365 suites, rust-check, ...).
# A wrong area gate SILENTLY skips a whole area's tests, so they fail OPEN:
#   - shared/global inputs (packages/**, the root manifests and lockfile,
#     patches/**, root tsconfig*, ci.yml, .github/scripts/**, docker/**,
#     root docker-compose* / Dockerfile*, scripts/**, ee/**) set EVERY area;
#   - a code path that matches no area rule (agent/**, e2e-tests/**, a new
#     top-level dir or app, ...) sets EVERY area;
#   - an area whose tests READ another area's files is also set when those
#     files change (see the cross-area block below). test-api carries the
#     repo-wide contract suites (Dockerfile/manifest enumeration over apps/*,
#     exchangeRateBoundary over apps/web/src + apps/portal/src, tierConfig
#     parity, the viewer input schema), so web/portal/viewer and every app's
#     Dockerfile/package.json also set `api`. `ci-area-gating.test.mjs` scans
#     the sources for such references and fails when one has no rule here.
# Docs paths set no area. apps/mobile/** sets none either: mobile is gated by
# its own `mobile-native-changes` filter and test-mobile rides `app`.
#
# `topology_browser` gates the one job that builds the production web bundle
# and drives it in a real Chromium (`topology-browser-gate` in ci.yml, #6117).
# It is deliberately narrow: only the topology UI, the build/CSP configuration
# that governs how the layout module worker is emitted and allowed to run, the
# shared topology contracts the bundle validates against, the specs/fixtures
# themselves, and this workflow. It is matched only inside the non-docs branch,
# so `topology_browser=true` always implies `code=true` — the gate builds and
# boots the web app, which is meaningless on a PR that skips the code jobs.
# Every path it matches also falls outside the tooling allowlist, so it implies
# `app=true` as well.
#
# Fail-closed: an empty file list is `code=true docs=true agent=true
# app=true topology_browser=true` and every area true. Deciding "nothing
# changed" from no evidence is how a broken listing would green a PR (or
# silently skip a job that should have run).
