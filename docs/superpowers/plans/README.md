# Implementation plans

Plan documents — ready-to-implement work orders (goal, architecture, tech stack,
`- [ ]` task checklist, linked spec). They're organized two ways:

- **`open/`** — the **work queue / inbox** (13 plans). Work that isn't finished:
  ready-to-grab, shipped-but-broken, design-only, blocked, or roadmap — each
  status-tagged. See [`open/README.md`](open/README.md) and the
  [Coding with Claude Code](https://docs.breezermm.com/contributing/coding-with-claude-code/)
  guide. When a plan's PR merges it moves into its domain folder below.
- **Domain folders** — the **archive** of completed/shipped work (256 plans),
  sorted by area. A 2026-07-21 completion audit (code-graph + memory cross-check)
  verified these as shipped.

Design specs for these plans live under `../specs/` in the same domain folders.

_Counts are a snapshot; they drift as plans move in/out of `open/`. The `notes/`
subfolder holds a few non-plan working docs and isn't a domain._

> Files are referenced by path from `CLAUDE.md`, code comments, and other docs.
> When adding a plan, drop it in `open/`; when moving a completed plan into a
> domain folder, update any references to its path.
