# Metric Anomaly Episodes W02 — API Surface Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Expose metric anomaly episodes over HTTP (list / detail / PATCH actions with snooze), keep evaluation labels intact with one feedback row per cascaded member, promote an episode to one alert that carries `context.episodeId`, close that alert when the episode clears or expires, and dispatch the AI-agent pilot once per episode instead of once per bucket.

**Architecture:** Three new API services sit on top of W01's schema and stages: `metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.ts` (read + serialize), `metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.ts` (locked, transactional human actions), `metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.ts` (the close-handler W01 exposes, wired at worker boot). The routes are registered on the existing `anomaliesRoutes` router in `routes/devices/anomalies.ts` and delegate to those services. Dispatch-per-episode is one change here: an amended claim CTE in the incident publisher. W01 already creates every incident with its `episode_id` (stage order `episodes` → `incidents`, second quorum A6), so W02 has no link statement and no grace window.

**Tech Stack:** Hono, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), Zod, Vitest (unit + `vitest.integration.config.ts`), BullMQ publisher job, `@breeze/shared` types.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-21-metric-anomaly-episodes-design.md` (§7 alert half, §8, §11, §12, §17 W02). Index and cross-wave contract: `docs/superpowers/plans/monitoring/2026-09-21-metric-anomaly-episodes.md`.

## Spec deviations (code wins; each one is also listed in the PR body)

| # | Spec says | Code fact (file:line) | This plan does |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | §11: the publisher skips an incident "when another incident with the same `episode_id` already has `agent_run_id IS NOT NULL`" | `agent_run_id` is stamped **after** publish by the subscriber, on the event bus, and only when admission succeeds (`apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/metricAnomalySubscriber.ts:50`, `:132-140`, `:196-212`). One claim pass takes up to 200 rows (`apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts:47`), so three incidents of one episode claimed together would all publish. | Suppress when a sibling with the same `episode_id` has `agent_run_id IS NOT NULL` **or** was already published (`dispatched_at IS NOT NULL AND suppressed_by_episode = false`), **and** allow only the earliest-`window_start` incident per episode inside one claim batch (`row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY episode_id …) > 1`). |
| D-2 | *(withdrawn by the second quorum, A6)* | The race it worked around — the `incidents` stage committing before assembly could link its rows — no longer exists: W01 runs `episodes` before `incidents` and writes `episode_id` at insert. | Nothing. Unlinked incidents (a timed-out `episodes` stage, rows outside the lookback) dispatch immediately, as §11 says. The earlier link statement, its wrapper and the 15-minute grace constant were deleted from this plan. |
| D-3 | §12 / index contract: routes live in a new module `routes/devices/anomalyEpisodes.ts` exported as `anomalyEpisodesRoutes` | Every route module needs an `MCP_COVERAGE` entry (`apps/api/src/__tests__/mcp-coverage.test.ts:195-197`). New `gap` entries are refused because the gap list only shrinks (`:1-6`, `FROZEN_GAPS`), and none of the `McpExemptReason` values (`apps/api/src/services/mcpCoverage.ts:12-40`) describes an operator-facing device read/write surface. The per-row anomaly routes already hold the `devices/anomalies.ts` gap (`mcp-coverage.test.ts:67`, frozen under #6141). | Register the three episode endpoints on the existing `anomaliesRoutes` in `routes/devices/anomalies.ts`. They are part of the same resource family and the same #6141 gap. The handlers are thin; all logic lives in the new services. The index row `anomalyEpisodesRoutes` was replaced at plan reconciliation. |
| D-4 | §8.1: `unsnooze` sets `snoozed_until = NULL` "on this episode" | §6 (W01): a new episode is snoozed when **the most recent dismissed episode** for the key has `snoozed_until > now()`, and snoozed successors copy `snoozed_until`. So clearing only an older episode would leave the snooze in force on its successor. | `unsnooze` clears `snoozed_until` on every `dismissed` episode for the same `(device_id, episode_key)` whose `snoozed_until > now()`. |
| D-5 | §8.1: `promote` runs `promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert` "on the peak member" | `promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert` sets `status = 'promoted'` on the row it is given whatever its current status (`apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.ts:258-266`). It also promotes same-window siblings before our cascade runs (`:284-299`), so those siblings would not be in the cascade's `RETURNING`. | Peak = highest-`score` member whose status is `open` or `promoted`; a member a human already dismissed or resolved through the per-row route is never overwritten. Feedback goes to `open-before ∪ cascaded`, filtered to rows that are `promoted` afterwards. |
| D-6 | §12 / index: `rangeMin`/`rangeMax` = min/max member `observedValue` | The ram and cpu families hold both `_sum` and `_max` members (§4.2). One range over both would mix "one process" values with "all top processes" values in one sentence. | Range is taken over members whose `metric_name = peak_metric_name`. The index row says so. |
| D-7 | §8.3 is silent on write semantics | `emitAnomalyFeedback` is best-effort: it swallows and logs errors (`apps/api/src/services/mlFeedbackEmitters.ts:10-16`, `:64-83`). §18 lists "evaluation labels silently vanish" as a risk. | Episode actions write their member feedback rows through a new batch writer that **throws**, inside the request transaction. If the labels cannot be written, the action rolls back with a 500. |
| D-8 | Spec §7 puts the alert resolve inside auto-resolve | `resolveAlert` publishes on the event bus and reads rule/cooldown tables (`apps/api/src/services/alertService.ts:715-830`). Running it inside the `episode-resolve` stage transaction keeps the org advisory lock and a pooled connection held during Redis round trips. A SQL error inside that transaction would also poison it and roll back the episode closes. | The handler runs **after** the stage transactions commit, outside any DB context. W01 already guarantees this: `detectMetricAnomaliesRange` collects the closes of every completed `episodes` and `episode-resolve` stage (assembly's supersedes come straight from `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes`; W02 wraps nothing) and calls `notifyEpisodesClosed(orgId, closed)` once after the stage loop (W01 Task 9); `processDetectOrgRange` holds no DB context. Task 7 Step 1 only verifies it. The handler is crash-safe either way: it re-derives its work from the database (auto-closed episodes in the last 24 h whose linked alert is still `active`) instead of trusting the in-memory list. |
| D-9 | §12 serialization lists `durationSeconds`, `ongoing`, `promoted`, `snoozed` (+ `rangeMin`/`rangeMax` in the index) | Remediation suggestions are keyed `sourceType: 'anomaly'` + `metric_anomalies.id` (`apps/web/src/components/remediation/RemediationSuggestionsPanel.tsx:33-34`, `:133`); an episode id finds nothing and `generate` would reference a non-anomaly id. | The DTO adds `peakAnomalyId` (highest-score member, W01's peak rule) so W04's card can mount the remediation block on a real anomaly id. Added at plan reconciliation. The second quorum (A9) also adds `deviceLastSeenAt: string \| null` (joined from `devices.last_seen_at`) so W04 can render "expired: device not seen since …"; the spec §12 now lists both. |

## Global Constraints

- W01a and W01b must be merged to `main` first (W01c is independent of this wave); this wave branches from `origin/main` after that. Branch: `feature/<parent#>-metric-anomaly-episodes/wave-<W02 sub-issue#>`; PR body carries `Closes #<W02 sub-issue#>`.
- Use the index's cross-wave names exactly: `metricAnomalyEpisodes`, `MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow` (W01, `db/schema/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts`), `metricAnomalies.episodeId`, `metricAnomalyIncidents.episodeId` (written by W01 at insert), `metricAnomalyIncidents.suppressedByEpisode`, `EPISODE_SNOOZE_DAYS`, `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes(range) → Promise<EpisodeCloseResult[]>`, `resolveMetricAnomalyEpisodes(orgId, rangeTo, now?)`, `closeEpisodesForDisabledDetection(orgId, now?)`, `EpisodeCloseResult`, `EpisodeCloseHandler`, `setEpisodeCloseHandler(fn | null)`, `notifyEpisodesClosed`, `MetricAnomalyStatus` / `METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES`, `MetricAnomalyEpisodeStatus`, `EpisodeCloseReason`, `EpisodeAttribution`, `MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto`, `EpisodeAction`, `applyEpisodeAction`.
- **Do not redefine W01's shared types.** `packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts` (and its test file) exist after W01; W02 appends to both and re-declares nothing W01 exports.
- **No migration, no new table, no new column.** W01 owns all schema, registrations and export-policy entries. If a step here seems to need DDL, stop: it is a W01 gap.
- **`alerts.episode_id` is not ours.** That column is the *monitor breach* episode (#5290; `apps/api/src/db/schema/alerts.ts:144-146`, written by `createAlert`/`createSourcedAlert` in `alertService.ts:170,250,380`). The anomaly episode id goes **only** into `alerts.context.episodeId` (JSON). Never set the column.
- Cascades touch member rows **only `WHERE status = 'open'`** (spec §8.2).
- Feedback: one `ml_feedback_events` row per labelled member, `sourceType: 'anomaly'`, `sourceId = member.id`, `eventType = 'anomaly.<dismissed|resolved|promoted>'`, `dedupeKey = 'episode:<episodeId>'`, `metadata.episodeId`. Automatic closes (`cleared`, `expired_*`) and snoozed successors emit **no** feedback. `sourceType: 'anomaly_episode'` is W03's job; do not add it.
- Actions: `resolve` / `dismiss` / `promote` need `status = 'open'` (else 409). `promote` also needs no linked alert (else 409). `unsnooze` needs `status = 'dismissed' AND snoozed_until > now()` (else 409). `resolveAlert` defaults to `true` and applies to **both** `resolve` and `dismiss` on a promoted episode (second quorum A7): either one resolves the linked alert unless the caller passes `resolveAlert: false`.
- Alert auto-resolve on automatic close: only when the alert is `active` and `requires_human = false`, and only for `cleared` / `expired_*`. Note text is exactly `Auto-resolved: anomaly episode cleared` (close_reason `cleared`) or `Auto-resolved: anomaly episode expired` (`expired_offline` / `expired_no_data`). A `detection_off` close (W01, flag turned off) **never** resolves the linked alert: nothing observed the device recover, so the alert stays for the alert workflow.
- Authorization mirrors the per-row routes exactly: `requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system')`; `DEVICES_READ` for GETs, `ALERTS_WRITE` for PATCH; `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck` → 403 on `SITE_ACCESS_DENIED`, 404 when null (cross-org is 404, never 403).
- DB context: route code runs inside the request's `withDbAccessContext` transaction. Services use the ambient `db` and **never** call `runOutsideDbContext` or open a second context. `resolveAlert` and `promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert` join the ambient transaction, because `withDbAccessContext` returns `fn()` directly when a context is held (`apps/api/src/db/index.ts:673-675`).
- List: `status=open|closed|all` (default `open`), `limit` 1..100 (default 25), `ref` = episode id **or** member anomaly id. A `ref` forces `status=all` and puts the referenced episode first. `closed` = `resolved|dismissed` with `resolved_at ≥ now − 7 d`. Detail returns at most 200 members, ordered by `window_start` ascending.
- UUID validation in Zod uses `z.string().guid()`, as the rest of the repo does (`routes/analytics.ts:292`).
- Run tests with `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <files>`. Never `pnpm --filter … test -- --run`. Integration: `pnpm test-stack up` once, then `pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration <file>` (no `--`), and `pnpm test-stack down` at the end.
- Typecheck: `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288 npx tsc --noEmit -p .; echo exit=$?`. Read `exit=`. Never pipe tsc into `tail`, because a heap OOM then reads as green.
- End every commit message with the session's attribution trailer.

### Task 1: Pre-flight on W01 + shared DTO types

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts`
- Test: `packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.test.ts` (W01 created it; append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (W01): `MetricAnomalyStatus`, `MetricAnomalyEpisodeStatus`, `EpisodeCloseReason`, `EpisodeAttribution` from the same file.
- Produces:
  - `EPISODE_ACTIONS = ['resolve','dismiss','promote','unsnooze'] as const`; `type EpisodeAction`
  - `EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES = ['open','closed','all'] as const`; `type EpisodeListStatus`
  - `EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT = 200`
  - `interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto`, `interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeMemberDto`, `interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto`, `interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse` (shapes below)

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify W01 is on main and delivered what this wave consumes**

```bash
git fetch origin main
git checkout -b feature/<parent#>-metric-anomaly-episodes/wave-<W02#> origin/main
rg -n "export const metricAnomalyEpisodes" apps/api/src/db/schema/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts
rg -n "episodeId|suppressedByEpisode" apps/api/src/db/schema/metricAnomalyIncidents.ts apps/api/src/db/schema/analytics.ts
rg -n "export (const|function|async function|type|interface) (assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes|resolveMetricAnomalyEpisodes|closeEpisodesForDisabledDetection|setEpisodeCloseHandler|notifyEpisodesClosed|EpisodeCloseResult|EpisodeCloseHandler)" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts
rg -n "export const EPISODE_SNOOZE_DAYS" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeKeys.ts
rg -n "Promise<EpisodeCloseResult\[\]>" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts
rg -n "METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES|MetricAnomalyEpisodeStatus|EpisodeCloseReason|EpisodeAttribution" packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts
rg -n "metricAnomalyEpisodes" packages/shared/src/types/index.ts
rg -n "notifyEpisodesClosed" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalies.ts
rg -n "METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES" apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.ts
```

Expected: every `rg` prints at least one hit (W01a **and** W01b must both be merged; W01c is not needed) (`EPISODE_SNOOZE_DAYS` lives in the leaf `metricAnomalyEpisodeKeys.ts` and is re-exported from `metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts` by `export *`). If any of the first seven prints nothing, stop: W01 has not merged, or it merged under different names. Reconcile against the index before continuing. The last command confirms W01 Task 1 already put `cleared` in the legacy list enum (`z.enum([...METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES, 'all'])`); only if it prints nothing does Task 6 Step 3b apply.

Also run `get_feature_status` for the parent issue, then `start_wave` for the W02 sub-issue (feature-lifecycle skill).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test**

Append to `packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.test.ts` (W01 created it). **Merge** the imports below into the file's existing `vitest` and `./metricAnomalyEpisodes` import statements (add `expectTypeOf` to the first) rather than adding second import statements for the same modules — a second `import { describe, … } from 'vitest'` is a duplicate-binding error:

```ts
import { describe, expect, expectTypeOf, it } from 'vitest';
import {
  EPISODE_ACTIONS,
  EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT,
  EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES,
  type EpisodeAction,
  type MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto,
  type MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto,
  type MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse,
} from './metricAnomalyEpisodes';

describe('metric anomaly episode API contract (W02)', () => {
  it('exposes exactly the four spec §8.1 actions, in order', () => {
    expect([...EPISODE_ACTIONS]).toEqual(['resolve', 'dismiss', 'promote', 'unsnooze']);
    expectTypeOf<EpisodeAction>().toEqualTypeOf<'resolve' | 'dismiss' | 'promote' | 'unsnooze'>();
  });

  it('exposes the three list filters of spec §12', () => {
    expect([...EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES]).toEqual(['open', 'closed', 'all']);
  });

  it('caps detail members at 200 (spec §12)', () => {
    expect(EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT).toBe(200);
  });

  it('DTO carries the derived fields the web card needs', () => {
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['durationSeconds']>().toEqualTypeOf<number>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['ongoing']>().toEqualTypeOf<boolean>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['promoted']>().toEqualTypeOf<boolean>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['snoozed']>().toEqualTypeOf<boolean>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['rangeMin']>().toEqualTypeOf<number | null>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['rangeMax']>().toEqualTypeOf<number | null>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['firstSeenAt']>().toEqualTypeOf<string>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['peakAnomalyId']>().toEqualTypeOf<string | null>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto['deviceLastSeenAt']>().toEqualTypeOf<string | null>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto['membersTruncated']>().toEqualTypeOf<boolean>();
    expectTypeOf<MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse['focusedEpisodeId']>().toEqualTypeOf<string | null>();
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL, because `EPISODE_ACTIONS` (and the rest) are not exported.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement**

Append to `packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts`:

```ts
// ── W02: episode API surface (spec §8.1, §12) ─────────────────────────────

export const EPISODE_ACTIONS = ['resolve', 'dismiss', 'promote', 'unsnooze'] as const;
export type EpisodeAction = (typeof EPISODE_ACTIONS)[number];

export const EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES = ['open', 'closed', 'all'] as const;
export type EpisodeListStatus = (typeof EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES)[number];

/** Spec §12: the detail endpoint returns at most this many members. */
export const EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT = 200;

/**

 * mix `_sum` and `_max` members and a range across both is meaningless.
 */
export interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto {
  id: string;
  orgId: string;
  deviceId: string;
  episodeKey: string;
  sourceTable: string;
  anomalyType: string;
  metricFamily: string;
  metricNames: string[];
  status: MetricAnomalyEpisodeStatus;
  closeReason: EpisodeCloseReason | null;
  firstSeenAt: string;
  lastSeenAt: string;

  /**

   */
  peakAnomalyId: string | null;
  /**
   * `devices.last_seen_at` of the episode's device (ISO), for the web card's
   * "expired: device not seen since …" chip (second quorum A9). NULL when the
   * device never checked in.
   */
  deviceLastSeenAt: string | null;
}

export interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeMemberDto {
  id: string;
  metricName: string;
  anomalyType: string;
  status: MetricAnomalyStatus;
  windowStart: string;
  windowEnd: string;
  observedValue: number;
  baselineValue: number | null;
  baselineMax: number | null;
  score: number;
  confidence: number;
  linkedAlertId: string | null;
}

export interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto extends MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto {
  members: MetricAnomalyEpisodeMemberDto[];
  /** true when the episode has more than EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT members. */
  membersTruncated: boolean;
}

export interface MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse {
  data: MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto[];
  /** The episode a `ref` resolved to (always data[0] when non-null). */
  focusedEpisodeId: string | null;
}
```

If Step 1 showed that `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` does not re-export the file, add `export * from './metricAnomalyEpisodes';` next to the other `export *` lines at the top of that index.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test and the shared typecheck**

Run: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.test.ts && npx tsc --noEmit -p .; echo exit=$?`
Expected: PASS, `exit=0`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts packages/shared/src/types/metricAnomalyEpisodes.test.ts packages/shared/src/types/index.ts
git commit -m "feat(shared): metric anomaly episode API DTOs and action constants (W02)"
```

### Task 2: Episode read service (serializer, list, detail, `ref`)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeFixtures.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 DTO types; W01 `metricAnomalyEpisodes`, `metricAnomalies.episodeId`.
- Produces:
  - re-export of W01's `type MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow` (from `db/schema`; not redefined)
  - `EPISODE_CLOSED_WINDOW_DAYS = 7`
  - `serializeMetricAnomalyEpisode(row: MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow, range: { min: number; max: number; peakAnomalyId?: string | null } | null | undefined, now: Date, deviceLastSeenAt?: Date | null): MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto` — the list/detail readers pass the device's `last_seen_at` (one lookup per call; every episode on a page belongs to the same device)
  - `serializeMetricAnomalyEpisodeMember(row: typeof metricAnomalies.$inferSelect): MetricAnomalyEpisodeMemberDto`
  - `listDeviceEpisodes(input: { orgId: string; deviceId: string; status: EpisodeListStatus; limit: number; ref?: string; now?: Date }): Promise<MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse>`
  - `getDeviceEpisodeDto(input: { orgId: string; deviceId: string; episodeId: string; now?: Date }): Promise<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto | null>`
  - `getDeviceEpisodeDetail(input: { orgId: string; deviceId: string; episodeId: string; now?: Date }): Promise<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto | null>`
  - Fixtures (integration): `seedTenant()`, `enableAnomalyDetection(orgId)`, `insertEpisodeDevice(orgId, siteId, lastSeenAt?)`, `seedEpisode(opts)`, `seedAlert(opts)`, `seedIncident(opts)`, `insertCleanRollups(opts)`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing serializer unit test**

`apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: {} }));

import {
  serializeMetricAnomalyEpisode,
  serializeMetricAnomalyEpisodeMember,
  type MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow,
} from './metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries';

const NOW = new Date('2026-09-22T00:30:00.000Z');

function row(overrides: Partial<MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow> = {}): MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow {
  return {
    id: '55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555555',
    orgId: '11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111',
    deviceId: '22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222',
    episodeKey: 'device_metrics:spike:disk_write',
    sourceTable: 'device_metrics',

### Task 3: Transactional per-member feedback writer

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedback.ts` (after `emitMlFeedbackEvent`, ~line 75)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedbackEmitters.ts` (after `emitAnomalyFeedback`, ~line 83)
- Test: `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedback.test.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedbackEmitters.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `emitMlFeedbackEvents(inputs: MlFeedbackEventInput[], database?: Pick<typeof db, 'insert'>): Promise<{ inserted: number }>`. It throws when any event has no `dedupeKey`, inserts in chunks of `ML_FEEDBACK_BATCH_SIZE = 500`, uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the semantic unique index, and **never swallows errors**.
  - `emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback(options: { orgId: string; episodeId: string; members: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; metricName: string; anomalyType: string }>; outcome: 'dismissed' | 'promoted' | 'resolved'; actorUserId?: string | null; occurredAt: Date; metadata?: Record<string, unknown> }): Promise<number>`. It returns the number of rows inserted.

Dedupe check (spec §8.3): the semantic unique is `(org_id, source_type, source_id, event_type, dedupe_key)` and the other unique is `(source_type, source_id, event_type, occurred_at)` (`apps/api/src/db/schema/mlFeedback.ts:36-44`). Every member row has a distinct `source_id`, so a 17-member dismiss can never collide with itself on either index. A member labelled earlier through the per-row route has `dedupe_key = 'status:dismissed'`. It is also no longer `open`, so the cascade never selects it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedback.test.ts` (its existing `beforeEach` already wires `insert → values → onConflictDoNothing → returning`). Add `emitMlFeedbackEvents` to the existing import from `'./mlFeedback'`:

```ts
describe('emitMlFeedbackEvents (batch, W02)', () => {
  const member = (i: number) => ({
    orgId: '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001',
    sourceType: 'anomaly' as const,
    sourceId: `00000000-0000-4000-8000-${String(100 + i).padStart(12, '0')}`,
    eventType: 'anomaly.dismissed' as const,
    dedupeKey: 'episode:00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000099',
    outcome: 'dismissed' as const,
    metadata: { episodeId: '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000099' },
    occurredAt: new Date('2026-09-22T00:00:00.000Z'),
  });

  it('inserts every event in one statement against the semantic dedupe target', async () => {
    dbMocks.returningMock.mockResolvedValue([{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }, { id: 'c' }]);

    const result = await emitMlFeedbackEvents([member(1), member(2), member(3)]);

    expect(result).toEqual({ inserted: 3 });
    expect(dbMocks.insertMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    const inserted = dbMocks.valuesMock.mock.calls[0]![0] as Array<Record<string, unknown>>;
    expect(inserted).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(inserted.map((r) => r.sourceId)).toEqual([member(1).sourceId, member(2).sourceId, member(3).sourceId]);
    const conflict = dbMocks.onConflictDoNothingMock.mock.calls[0]![0] as { target: unknown[]; where: unknown };
    expect(conflict.target).toHaveLength(5);
    expect(conflict.where).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('refuses an event without a dedupeKey and writes nothing', async () => {
    const { dedupeKey: _omit, ...noKey } = member(1);
    await expect(emitMlFeedbackEvents([member(2), noKey])).rejects.toThrow(/dedupeKey/);
    expect(dbMocks.insertMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it('chunks at 500 rows', async () => {
    dbMocks.returningMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(new Array(500).fill({ id: 'x' }));
    dbMocks.returningMock.mockResolvedValueOnce([{ id: 'y' }]);
    const result = await emitMlFeedbackEvents(Array.from({ length: 501 }, (_, i) => member(i)));
    expect(dbMocks.insertMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
    expect(result).toEqual({ inserted: 501 });
  });

  it('is a no-op for an empty list', async () => {
    expect(await emitMlFeedbackEvents([])).toEqual({ inserted: 0 });
    expect(dbMocks.insertMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it('propagates insert failures (never best-effort)', async () => {
    dbMocks.returningMock.mockRejectedValue(new Error('connection lost'));
    await expect(emitMlFeedbackEvents([member(1)])).rejects.toThrow('connection lost');
  });
});
```

In `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedbackEmitters.test.ts`, extend the module mock and add a suite:

```ts
// at the top, next to `const emitMlFeedbackEvent = vi.fn();`
const emitMlFeedbackEvents = vi.fn();

vi.mock('./mlFeedback', () => ({
  emitMlFeedbackEvent: (...args: unknown[]) => emitMlFeedbackEvent(...args),
  emitMlFeedbackEvents: (...args: unknown[]) => emitMlFeedbackEvents(...args),
}));
```

Add `emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback` to the import list, then:

```ts
describe('emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback (W02)', () => {
  const EPISODE = '99999999-9999-4999-8999-999999999999';
  beforeEach(() => {
    emitMlFeedbackEvents.mockReset();
    emitMlFeedbackEvents.mockResolvedValue({ inserted: 2 });
  });

  it('writes one anomaly-sourced row per member with the episode dedupe key and metadata', async () => {
    const inserted = await emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback({
      orgId: 'org-1',
      episodeId: EPISODE,
      members: [
        { id: 'm-1', metricName: 'top_process_ram_mb_max', anomalyType: 'process_runaway' },
        { id: 'm-2', metricName: 'top_process_ram_mb_sum', anomalyType: 'process_runaway' },
      ],
      outcome: 'dismissed',
      actorUserId: VALID_UUID,
      occurredAt: new Date('2026-09-22T00:00:00.000Z'),
      metadata: { route: 'devices.anomalyEpisodes.action' },
    });

    expect(inserted).toBe(2);
    const events = emitMlFeedbackEvents.mock.calls[0]![0] as Array<Record<string, any>>;
    expect(events).toHaveLength(2);
    for (const [i, event] of events.entries()) {
      expect(event).toMatchObject({
        orgId: 'org-1',
        sourceType: 'anomaly',
        sourceId: `m-${i + 1}`,
        eventType: 'anomaly.dismissed',
        outcome: 'dismissed',
        dedupeKey: `episode:${EPISODE}`,
        actorUserId: VALID_UUID,
      });
      expect(event.metadata).toMatchObject({ episodeId: EPISODE, route: 'devices.anomalyEpisodes.action' });
    }
    expect(events[1]!.metadata.metricName).toBe('top_process_ram_mb_sum');
  });

  it('normalizes a non-uuid actor to null', async () => {
    await emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback({
      orgId: 'org-1', episodeId: EPISODE, members: [{ id: 'm-1', metricName: 'cpu_percent', anomalyType: 'spike' }],
      outcome: 'resolved', actorUserId: 'system', occurredAt: new Date(),
    });
    expect((emitMlFeedbackEvents.mock.calls[0]![0] as Array<Record<string, unknown>>)[0]!.actorUserId).toBeNull();
  });

  it('propagates writer errors instead of swallowing them', async () => {
    emitMlFeedbackEvents.mockRejectedValue(new Error('boom'));
    await expect(emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback({
      orgId: 'org-1', episodeId: EPISODE, members: [{ id: 'm-1', metricName: 'cpu_percent', anomalyType: 'spike' }],
      outcome: 'promoted', occurredAt: new Date(),
    })).rejects.toThrow('boom');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them and watch them fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/mlFeedback.test.ts src/services/mlFeedbackEmitters.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL. `emitMlFeedbackEvents` / `emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback` are not exported.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `apps/api/src/services/mlFeedback.ts`, after `emitMlFeedbackEvent`:

```ts

 * batch targets only the semantic unique index, and replays are no-ops.
 */
export async function emitMlFeedbackEvents(
  inputs: MlFeedbackEventInput[],
  database: MlFeedbackWritableDb = db,
): Promise<{ inserted: number }> {
  if (inputs.length === 0) return { inserted: 0 };
  const events = inputs.map((input) => {
    const event = mlFeedbackEventSchema.parse(input);
    if (!event.dedupeKey) {
      throw new Error('emitMlFeedbackEvents requires a dedupeKey on every event');
    }
    assertMlFeedbackMetadataWithinLimit(event.metadata);
    return event;
  });

  let inserted = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i += ML_FEEDBACK_BATCH_SIZE) {

### Task 4: Promotion carries `context.episodeId`

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.ts:61-67` (options type) and `:225-243` (alert `context`)
- Test: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `PromoteMetricAnomalyToAlertOptions.episodeId?: string | null`. When set and a **new** alert is created, `alerts.context.episodeId = episodeId`. The `alerts.episode_id` column is never written. For the reuse paths (`created: false`) the caller stamps the context itself (Task 5).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append inside the existing `describe('metric anomaly promotion service', …)` in `metricAnomalyPromotion.test.ts`:

```ts
  it('writes the anomaly episode id into the new alert context, never the alerts.episode_id column', async () => {
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([anomaly]));
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([])); // dedupe siblings
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([])); // incident agent_run_id lookup
    insertMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([{ id: '44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444' }]));
    updateMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([{ ...anomaly, status: 'promoted', linkedAlertId: '44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444' }]));

    await promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert({
      orgId: anomaly.orgId,
      deviceId: anomaly.deviceId,
      anomalyId: anomaly.id,
      actorUserId: 'user-1',
      requireCreateAlertsFlag: false,
      episodeId: '55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555555',
    });

    const insertedChain = insertMock.mock.results[0]!.value as { values: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn> };
    const values = insertedChain.values.mock.calls[0]![0] as Record<string, unknown>;
    expect(values.context).toMatchObject({
      source: 'metric_anomaly',
      anomalyId: anomaly.id,
      episodeId: '55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555555',
    });
    // alerts.episode_id is the MONITOR breach episode (#5290) — never ours.
    expect(values).not.toHaveProperty('episodeId');
  });

  it('omits context.episodeId when no episode is given (per-row route unchanged)', async () => {
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([anomaly]));
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([]));
    selectMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([]));
    insertMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([{ id: '44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444' }]));
    updateMock.mockReturnValueOnce(chain([{ ...anomaly, status: 'promoted' }]));

    await promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert({ orgId: anomaly.orgId, deviceId: anomaly.deviceId, anomalyId: anomaly.id });

    const insertedChain = insertMock.mock.results[0]!.value as { values: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn> };
    const values = insertedChain.values.mock.calls[0]![0] as { context: Record<string, unknown> };
    expect(values.context).not.toHaveProperty('episodeId');
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and watch it fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.test.ts`
Expected: the first new test fails, because `context` has no `episodeId`. tsc would also reject the unknown option, but vitest does not typecheck.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `PromoteMetricAnomalyToAlertOptions`, add:

```ts
  /**
   * Metric anomaly EPISODE (spec §12, W02) this promotion is for. Written to
   * the new alert's `context.episodeId` only. Never to `alerts.episode_id`:
   * that column is the monitor breach episode (#5290).
   */
  episodeId?: string | null;
```

In the `context: { … }` object of the alert insert, after `agentRunId: incidentAgentRunId,`:

```ts
        ...(options.episodeId ? { episodeId: options.episodeId } : {}),
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run and watch it pass**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.ts apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyPromotion.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): anomaly promotion stamps context.episodeId (W02)"
```

### Task 5: Episode actions service (`resolve` / `dismiss` / `promote` / `unsnooze`)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `EPISODE_SNOOZE_DAYS` (W01), `resolveAlert(alertId, note?, resolvedBy?) → Promise<boolean>` (`alertService.ts:715`), `promoteMetricAnomalyToAlert` with `episodeId` (Task 4), `emitAnomalyEpisodeMemberFeedback` (Task 3), `emitAlertStateFeedback` (existing).
- Produces:
  - `type EpisodeActionConflict = 'episode_closed' | 'already_promoted' | 'not_snoozed' | 'no_promotable_member' | 'promotion_disabled'`
  - `EPISODE_ACTION_CONFLICT_MESSAGES: Record<EpisodeActionConflict, string>`
  - `DEFAULT_EPISODE_RESOLVE_NOTE = 'Resolved with its anomaly episode'`, `DEFAULT_EPISODE_DISMISS_NOTE = 'Resolved: anomaly episode dismissed'` (second quorum A7: a dismiss of a promoted episode resolves its alert too, unless `resolveAlert: false`)
  - `decideEpisodeAction(episode: { status: string; linkedAlertId: string | null; snoozedUntil: Date | null }, action: EpisodeAction, now: Date): { ok: true } | { ok: false; reason: 'episode_closed' | 'already_promoted' | 'not_snoozed' }`
  - `interface ApplyEpisodeActionInput { orgId: string; deviceId: string; episodeId: string; action: EpisodeAction; note?: string; resolveAlert?: boolean; actorUserId: string; now?: Date }`
  - `type ApplyEpisodeActionResult = { status: 'not_found' } | { status: 'conflict'; reason: EpisodeActionConflict; message: string } | { status: 'ok'; episodeId: string; action: EpisodeAction; alertId: string | null; alertResolved: boolean; labelledMemberIds: string[]; feedbackInserted: number }`
  - `applyEpisodeAction(input: ApplyEpisodeActionInput): Promise<ApplyEpisodeActionResult>`. Runs on the ambient context and takes `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the episode row first, which serializes two concurrent clicks and a racing auto-resolve stage.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing precondition unit test**

pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.integration.test.ts
```
Expected: PASS (14 unit cases from `it.each`, 13 integration tests). The two A7 dismiss cases are red against a `dismissEpisode` that leaves the alert alone.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.ts apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): episode actions — resolve/dismiss+snooze/promote/unsnooze with per-member labels (W02)"
```

### Task 6: Episode routes on `anomaliesRoutes`

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.episodes.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.test.ts` (add module mocks only)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2 `listDeviceEpisodes`, `getDeviceEpisodeDetail`, `getDeviceEpisodeDto`; Task 5 `applyEpisodeAction`; Task 1 `EPISODE_ACTIONS`, `EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES`.
- Produces (HTTP; W04 consumes these):
  - `GET /devices/:id/anomaly-episodes?status&limit&ref` → `200 MetricAnomalyEpisodeListResponse`
  - `GET /devices/:id/anomaly-episodes/:episodeId` → `200 { data: MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto }` | 404
  - `PATCH /devices/:id/anomaly-episodes/:episodeId` body `{ action, note?, resolveAlert? }` → `200 { data: MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto, meta: { alertId: string | null; alertResolved: boolean; labelledMembers: number } }` | 400 | 403 | 404 | `409 { error, reason }`

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and watch it fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/anomalies.episodes.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL. The episode paths return 404, because no handler exists.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the endpoints**

In `apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.ts`, extend W01's existing `import { METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES } from '@breeze/shared';` line (one import per module) and add the rest:

```ts
import { EPISODE_ACTIONS, EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES, METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES } from '@breeze/shared';
import { writeRouteAudit } from '../../services/auditEvents';
import { applyEpisodeAction } from '../../services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions';
import {
  getDeviceEpisodeDetail,
  getDeviceEpisodeDto,
  listDeviceEpisodes,
} from '../../services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries';
```

Then, after the last existing handler, add:

```ts
// ── Metric anomaly EPISODES (spec §8, §12 — W02) ─────────────────────────
// Registered here, not in a new module: the per-row anomaly routes and these
// share one resource family and one MCP_COVERAGE gap (#6141) — see the W02
// plan's spec deviation D-3.

const episodeListQuerySchema = z.object({
  status: z.enum(EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES).optional().default('open'),
  limit: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(100).optional().default(25),
  ref: z.string().guid().optional(),
});

const episodeParamSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  episodeId: z.string().guid(),
});

const episodeActionSchema = z.object({
  action: z.enum(EPISODE_ACTIONS),
  note: z.string().trim().max(500).optional(),

- [ ] **Step 3b: Legacy `cleared` (W01 owns it — normally a no-op).** W01 Task 1 Steps 5-7 already changed `anomaliesQuerySchema.status` to `z.enum([...METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES, 'all'])` and added the `accepts status=cleared on the legacy list route` test to `anomalies.test.ts`. Only if Task 1 Step 1's last `rg -n "METRIC_ANOMALY_STATUSES" apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.ts` printed nothing, apply exactly W01 Task 1 Steps 5-7 here (same code, same test). The per-row PATCH enum stays `dismissed | promoted | resolved`: `cleared` is machine-only.

- [ ] **Step 4: Keep the existing per-row test isolated from the new imports**

In `apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.test.ts`, add next to the other `vi.mock` calls:

```ts
vi.mock('../../services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries', () => ({
  listDeviceEpisodes: vi.fn(),
  getDeviceEpisodeDetail: vi.fn(),
  getDeviceEpisodeDto: vi.fn(),
}));
vi.mock('../../services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions', () => ({ applyEpisodeAction: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('../../services/auditEvents', () => ({ writeRouteAudit: vi.fn() }));
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the route tests and the static route contracts**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/anomalies.episodes.test.ts src/routes/devices/anomalies.test.ts src/__tests__/mcp-coverage.test.ts
pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:site-scope-coverage
```
Expected: all PASS. `mcp-coverage` stays green because no new route module was added. `site-scope-coverage` passes because every handler calls `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.episodes.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/anomalies.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): device anomaly episode routes — list/detail/PATCH actions (W02)"
```

### Task 7: Alert auto-resolve on automatic close (spec §7, alert half)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.integration.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalies.ts:246` (`initializeMetricAnomaliesWorker`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalies.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: W01 `setEpisodeCloseHandler(fn: EpisodeCloseHandler | null)` where `EpisodeCloseHandler = (orgId: string, closed: EpisodeCloseResult[]) => Promise<void>`, invoked by W01's `notifyEpisodesClosed` (which already catches, logs and Sentry-captures a handler error); `EpisodeCloseResult`; `resolveAlert` (`alertService.ts:715`).
- Produces:
  - `AUTO_CLOSE_REASONS = ['cleared', 'expired_offline', 'expired_no_data'] as const` — the automatic closes that resolve a linked alert; `detection_off` (W01, A5) is deliberately absent
  - `EPISODE_ALERT_CATCHUP_HOURS = 24`
  - `autoResolveNoteFor(closeReason: string | null): string`
  - `resolveAlertsForAutoClosedEpisodes(orgId: string, now?: Date): Promise<number>`. Returns the number of alerts resolved.
  - `handleEpisodesClosed(orgId: string, closed: EpisodeCloseResult[]): Promise<void>`. Never throws; logs and captures instead.
  - `registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandler(): void`

**DB-context decision.** The handler opens its work with `withSystemDbAccessContext` and never calls `runOutsideDbContext`. Called outside any context, it opens one short system transaction for itself. Called inside one, it joins, which means no second pooled connection is ever taken (CLAUDE.md #1105/#2417). The correct call site is **after** the stage transactions commit, because of the reasons in spec deviation D-8. W01 already calls it there; Step 1 verifies that. The handler does not trust the list it is given. It re-selects "auto-closed in the last 24 h, linked alert still `active`, `requires_human = false`". A crash between the episode close and the alert resolve is therefore repaired on the next close in that org, and a second invocation is a no-op because `resolveAlert` is a CAS.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify W01's invocation site (no code change expected)**

```bash
rg -n "notifyEpisodesClosed|pending.closed|closed.push" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalies.ts
rg -n "export async function notifyEpisodesClosed|export function setEpisodeCloseHandler" apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts
```

Read every hit. W01 Task 9 ships this shape in `detectMetricAnomaliesRange`, and it is what this task relies on:

```ts
  for (const [stage, run] of orderedStages) {
    pending.closed = [];
    const result = await runDetectionStage(stage, options.orgId, run);
    stages.push(result);
    if (result.outcome === 'completed') closed.push(...pending.closed);
    …
  }
  … // optional v1-shadow stage
  // After every stage transaction has committed, outside any DB context.
  await notifyEpisodesClosed(options.orgId, closed);
```

Check three things: (1) `closed` collects from BOTH the `episodes` stage (supersedes, returned by `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes` itself — W02 wraps nothing) and the `episode-resolve` stage (which, with the flag off, returns `detection_off` closes that the handler ignores); (2) only `completed` stages contribute (a timed-out or locked stage rolled back); (3) `notifyEpisodesClosed` is called once, after the loop, not inside a stage closure, and `processDetectOrgRange` (`jobs/metricAnomalies.ts`) holds no DB context. If W01 merged a different shape, restore this one inside W01's function and re-run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/metricAnomalies.test.ts` (W01's `hands every auto-closed episode to the close handler once, after the stages` test pins it).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing unit test**

`apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.test.ts`:

```ts
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

const { withSystemDbAccessContextMock, setEpisodeCloseHandlerMock, captureExceptionMock, resolveAlertMock } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  withSystemDbAccessContextMock: vi.fn(),
  setEpisodeCloseHandlerMock: vi.fn(),
  captureExceptionMock: vi.fn(),
  resolveAlertMock: vi.fn(),
}));

vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: {}, withSystemDbAccessContext: withSystemDbAccessContextMock }));
vi.mock('./alertService', () => ({ resolveAlert: resolveAlertMock }));
vi.mock('./metricAnomalyEpisodes', () => ({ setEpisodeCloseHandler: setEpisodeCloseHandlerMock }));
vi.mock('./sentry', () => ({ captureException: captureExceptionMock }));

import {
  AUTO_CLOSE_REASONS,
  autoResolveNoteFor,
  handleEpisodesClosed,
  registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandler,
} from './metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts';

describe('metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts', () => {
  beforeEach(() => vi.clearAllMocks());

  it('uses the exact spec §7 notes', () => {
    expect(autoResolveNoteFor('cleared')).toBe('Auto-resolved: anomaly episode cleared');
    expect(autoResolveNoteFor('expired_offline')).toBe('Auto-resolved: anomaly episode expired');
    expect(autoResolveNoteFor('expired_no_data')).toBe('Auto-resolved: anomaly episode expired');
  });

  it('never auto-resolves on a detection_off close (A5)', () => {
    expect(AUTO_CLOSE_REASONS).toEqual(['cleared', 'expired_offline', 'expired_no_data']);
    expect(AUTO_CLOSE_REASONS).not.toContain('detection_off');
  });

  it('registers handleEpisodesClosed as the W01 close hook', () => {
    registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandler();
    expect(setEpisodeCloseHandlerMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(handleEpisodesClosed);
  });

  it('never throws out of the hook: logs and captures instead', async () => {
    withSystemDbAccessContextMock.mockRejectedValue(new Error('db down'));
    const errorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
    await expect(handleEpisodesClosed('org-1', [])).resolves.toBeUndefined();
    expect(captureExceptionMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ message: 'db down' }));
    errorSpy.mockRestore();
  });
});
```

In `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalies.test.ts`, add a hoisted `registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandlerMock` (put it in that file's existing `vi.hoisted` block, or add `const { registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandlerMock } = vi.hoisted(() => ({ registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandlerMock: vi.fn() }));`) and the mock:

```ts
vi.mock('../services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts', () => ({
  registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandler: registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandlerMock,
}));
```

Then add inside the describe that already calls `initializeMetricAnomaliesWorker()` (around line 168):

```ts
  it('wires the episode close → alert auto-resolve handler at worker init', async () => {
    await initializeMetricAnomaliesWorker();
    expect(registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandlerMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
```

Copy that describe's existing `beforeEach` setup for Queue/Worker mocks. The new case reuses it unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing integration test**

`apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.integration.test.ts`:

  publishEventMock: vi.fn<(...args: unknown[]) => Promise<string>>(async () => 'test-event-id'),
}));
vi.mock('../../services/eventBus', async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import('../../services/eventBus')>();
  return { ...actual, publishEvent: publishEventMock };

pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.integration.test.ts
```
Expected: FAIL. The module is missing, and the init test sees 0 calls.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement**

`apps/api/src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.ts`:

```ts
import { and, eq, gte, inArray, ne } from 'drizzle-orm';

import { db, withSystemDbAccessContext } from '../db';
import { alerts, metricAnomalyEpisodes } from '../db/schema';
import { resolveAlert } from './alertService';

/**
 * Spec §7 alert half: when an episode closes automatically (cleared /
 * expired_*), resolve its linked alert if that alert is still `active` and
 * not `requires_human`. Promoted anomaly alerts have ruleId NULL, so
 * checkAutoResolve never closes them (alertService.ts:455-457); this is their
 * only automatic path. A `detection_off` close (flag turned off, W01 A5) is
 * NOT in AUTO_CLOSE_REASONS: nothing observed the device recover, so its
 * alert stays for the alert workflow.
 *
 * Crash-safe by construction: the work set is re-derived from the database
 * (auto-closed within EPISODE_ALERT_CATCHUP_HOURS, alert still active), not
 * from the in-memory list, and resolveAlert is a CAS — so a lost invocation is
 * repaired by the next one and a repeated one is a no-op.
 *
 * DB context: withSystemDbAccessContext only — opens a short transaction
 * when called outside a context (the intended call site: after the
 * episode-resolve stage commits) and joins one otherwise. Never
 * runOutsideDbContext, so it can never take a second pooled connection.

### Task 8: Pre-flight — incidents already carry `episode_id` (verification only)

The second quorum (A6) moved the incident link into W01: the `episodes` stage runs **before** `incidents`, and `upsertMetricAnomalyIncidents` writes each incident's `episode_id` at insert (the episode of its highest-score member, `COALESCE` on conflict). This wave therefore writes **no** link statement, no `episodes`-stage wrapper and no grace window — Task 9 only amends the publisher claim. This task checks that W01 delivered it; it changes no code.

**Files:** none.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (W01): `METRIC_ANOMALY_STAGES` order `baseline, growth-trend, process-runaway, episodes, incidents, episode-resolve, v1-shadow`; `metric_anomaly_incidents.episode_id` written by `upsertMetricAnomalyIncidents`; the `episodes` stage calling `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes(range)` directly and forwarding its `EpisodeCloseResult[]`.
- Produces: nothing.

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the stage order, the incident insert and the stage entry**

```bash

Expected: `'episodes'` precedes `'incidents'` in both `METRIC_ANOMALY_STAGES` and `orderedStages`; both incident-SQL fragments print; the stage entry calls assembly directly. If any is missing, W01b has not merged or merged differently — stop and reconcile against the index; do not add a link statement here.

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/metricAnomalies.test.ts -t "A6"
pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodes.integration.test.ts -t "created already linked"
```

Expected: PASS (W01's `runs assembly before incidents`, `each incident carries the episode of its highest-score member`, and the integration `an incident is created already linked to its episode`). Record the output in the PR body.

### Task 9: Publisher dispatches at most once per episode

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts` (constants block ~line 46, `ClaimedIncidentRow`, `PublishIncidentsResult`, `scanAndClaimIncidentRows` claim statement ~lines 140-157, `publishPendingIncidents`, worker log line)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (W01): `metric_anomaly_incidents.episode_id`, already written at insert (Task 8 verified it).
- Produces:
  - `PublishIncidentsResult = { published: number; skipped: number; suppressed: number }`
  - Claim semantics (spec §11 + deviation D-1): an incident is claimable when `dispatched_at IS NULL` and `dispatch_attempts <= 5` — unchanged, no grace window (D-2 withdrawn). A claimed incident is **suppressed**, meaning `dispatched_at = now()` and `suppressed_by_episode = true` and it is never published, when it has an `episode_id` **and** either (a) it is not the earliest-`window_start` incident of that episode in this batch, or (b) another incident of the same episode already has `agent_run_id IS NOT NULL` or was already published (`dispatched_at IS NOT NULL AND suppressed_by_episode = false`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit tests**

In `apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.test.ts`:

1. Every existing `expect(result).toEqual({ published: X, skipped: Y })` / `expect(second).toEqual({ … })` gains `suppressed: 0`. The four sites are the publish test, the stuck-row test, the empty-claim test's `second`, and the publishEvent-rejects test.
2. `claimedRow()` gains `suppressed_by_episode: false` in its defaults and override type.
3. Add:

```ts
  it('never publishes a row the claim marked suppressed_by_episode, and counts it', async () => {
    executeMock.mockResolvedValueOnce({ rows: [] }); // stuck scan
    executeMock.mockResolvedValueOnce({
      rows: [
        claimedRow({ id: 'incident-a' }),
        claimedRow({ id: 'incident-b', suppressed_by_episode: true }),
        claimedRow({ id: 'incident-c', suppressed_by_episode: true }),
      ],
    });
    const chain = makeUpdateChain();
    updateMock.mockReturnValue({ set: chain.set });

    const result = await publishPendingIncidents();

    expect(result).toEqual({ published: 1, skipped: 0, suppressed: 2 });
    expect(publishEventMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(publishEventMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      'anomaly.incident_opened', 'org-1', { incidentId: 'incident-a', deviceId: 'device-1' }, 'metric-anomaly-incident-publisher',
    );
    expect(updateMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // mark-dispatched for incident-a only
  });

  it('a claim of only suppressed rows publishes nothing and marks nothing', async () => {
    executeMock.mockResolvedValueOnce({ rows: [] });
    executeMock.mockResolvedValueOnce({ rows: [claimedRow({ id: 'incident-z', suppressed_by_episode: true })] });

    const result = await publishPendingIncidents();

    expect(result).toEqual({ published: 0, skipped: 0, suppressed: 1 });
    expect(publishEventMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(updateMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
```

4. Add this suite next to the existing source-level `describe` blocks:

```ts
describe('metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher — one dispatch per episode (W02, source-level)', () => {
  const src = () => fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts'), 'utf8');

  it('suppresses all but the earliest incident of an episode within one claim batch', () => {
    expect(src()).toContain('PARTITION BY d.episode_id ORDER BY d.window_start, d.id');
  });

  it('suppresses when a sibling was already published or already has an agent run', () => {
    expect(src()).toContain('s.agent_run_id IS NOT NULL');
    expect(src()).toContain('s.dispatched_at IS NOT NULL AND s.suppressed_by_episode = false');
  });

  it('marks suppressed rows dispatched in the claim itself so they are never re-claimed', () => {
    expect(src()).toContain('dispatched_at = CASE WHEN decided.suppress THEN now() ELSE i.dispatched_at END');
    expect(src()).toContain('suppressed_by_episode = decided.suppress');
  });

  it('holds nothing back: an unlinked incident is claimable at once (D-2 withdrawn, A6)', () => {
    expect(src()).not.toContain('make_interval(mins =>');
    expect(src()).not.toContain('created_at < now()');
  });
});
```

The existing guards still hold: exactly two `WHERE ${metricAnomalyIncidents.dispatchedAt} IS NULL` and exactly two `ORDER BY ${…}, ${…}`. The new SQL uses raw aliased column names, so it adds neither pattern.

- [ ] **Step 2: Append the failing integration tests**

Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts`:

```ts

    await seedIncident({ orgId: org.id, deviceId, episodeId: ep.episodeId, windowStart: start });

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run and watch them fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.test.ts
pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts
```
Expected: FAIL. The result has no `suppressed`, the per-episode source strings are absent, and in integration all three incidents of one episode publish. (The unlinked-incident case and the `holds nothing back` source check already pass — they pin that no grace window sneaks in.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement**

In `metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts`:

No new constant: W01 creates every incident already linked (A6), so there is nothing to wait for.

`ClaimedIncidentRow` gains `suppressed_by_episode: boolean;`. `PublishIncidentsResult` gains `suppressed: number;`.

Replace the claim statement in `scanAndClaimIncidentRows` with:

```ts
  // Atomically claim live rows, bump dispatch_attempts, and decide one
  // dispatch per episode (spec §11 + W02 deviation D-1). episode_id was
  // written at insert by W01 (stage order episodes -> incidents), so there is
  // no grace window. A suppressed row is marked dispatched here, in the
  // claim, so it is never claimed again and never published.
  const claimed = await db.execute<ClaimedIncidentRow>(sql`
    WITH due AS (
      SELECT id, episode_id, window_start
      FROM ${metricAnomalyIncidents}
      WHERE ${metricAnomalyIncidents.dispatchedAt} IS NULL
        AND ${metricAnomalyIncidents.dispatchAttempts} <= ${MAX_PUBLISH_ATTEMPTS}
      ORDER BY ${metricAnomalyIncidents.orgId}, ${metricAnomalyIncidents.id}
      LIMIT ${MAX_PUBLISH_PER_RUN}
      FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    ),
    decided AS (
      SELECT
        d.id,
        (
          d.episode_id IS NOT NULL
          AND (
            row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY d.episode_id ORDER BY d.window_start, d.id) > 1
            OR EXISTS (
              SELECT 1
              FROM metric_anomaly_incidents s
              WHERE s.episode_id = d.episode_id
                AND s.id <> d.id
                AND (
                  s.agent_run_id IS NOT NULL
                  OR (s.dispatched_at IS NOT NULL AND s.suppressed_by_episode = false)
                )
            )
          )
        ) AS suppress
      FROM due d
    )
    UPDATE ${metricAnomalyIncidents} AS i
    SET dispatch_attempts = i.dispatch_attempts + 1,
        dispatched_at = CASE WHEN decided.suppress THEN now() ELSE i.dispatched_at END,
        suppressed_by_episode = decided.suppress
    FROM decided
    WHERE i.id = decided.id
    RETURNING i.id, i.org_id, i.device_id, i.dispatch_attempts, i.suppressed_by_episode;
  `);
```

Rewrite the body of `publishPendingIncidents` after the claim:

```ts
  const { stuckRows, claimedRows } = await runWithSystemDbAccess(scanAndClaimIncidentRows);

  if (claimedRows.length === 0) {
    return { published: 0, skipped: stuckRows.length, suppressed: 0 };
  }

  const toPublish = claimedRows.filter((row) => !row.suppressed_by_episode);
  const suppressed = claimedRows.length - toPublish.length;
  if (toPublish.length === 0) {
    return { published: 0, skipped: stuckRows.length, suppressed };
  }

  const publishedIds = await runOutsideDbContext(() => publishClaimedRows(toPublish));

  if (publishedIds.length > 0) {
    await runWithSystemDbAccess(() => markIncidentRowsDispatched(publishedIds));
  }

  if (claimedRows.length === MAX_PUBLISH_PER_RUN) {
    console.warn(
      `[MetricAnomalyIncidentPublisher] Hit ${MAX_PUBLISH_PER_RUN}-item cap — backlog may be growing`,
    );
  }

  return { published: publishedIds.length, skipped: stuckRows.length, suppressed };
```

In `createWorker`, change the result handling to:

```ts
        const { published, skipped, suppressed } = await publishPendingIncidents();
        if (published > 0 || skipped > 0 || suppressed > 0) {
          console.log(
            `[MetricAnomalyIncidentPublisher] Published ${published} incident(s), ${suppressed} suppressed by episode, ${skipped} stuck`,
          );
        }
        return { published, skipped, suppressed };
```

Search for other callers: `rg -n "publishPendingIncidents" apps/api/src --glob '!*.test.ts'`. Any caller that destructures the result keeps working, because the change only adds a field.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and watch them pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.test.ts
pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalySubscriberAdmission.integration.test.ts
```
Expected: PASS. The subscriber admission suite is unaffected.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts apps/api/src/jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): anomaly incident publisher dispatches once per episode (W02)"

### Task 10: HTTP-level proofs: evaluation labels, cross-org, `ref`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `anomaliesRoutes` (Task 6), `analyticsRoutes` (`routes/analytics.ts:27`), `createIntegrationTestClient` (`__tests__/integration/db-utils.ts:560`, org-scope wildcard role), fixtures.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run: `pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeRoutes.integration.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, because Tasks 2–6 already implemented the behaviour. This task adds end-to-end proof at the HTTP layer. It is not red-first, because no production code changes here. To confirm the assertions can fail, run this control: temporarily change `labelMembers` in `metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.ts` to `return 0` before the emit, rerun, and watch the first test fail on `after.total - before.total` (0 ≠ 17). Revert, rerun, and confirm green. Record the control in the PR body.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeRoutes.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(api): HTTP proofs for anomaly episodes — evaluation labels, cross-org 404, ref (W02)"
```

### Task 11: Verification, contract index, PR

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/monitoring/2026-09-21-metric-anomaly-episodes.md` (contract table)

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the cross-wave contract table** in the index. The W02 rows (episode routes on `anomaliesRoutes`, the four DTOs incl. `peakAnomalyId` and `deviceLastSeenAt`, `EPISODE_ACTIONS` / `EPISODE_LIST_STATUSES` / `EPISODE_DETAIL_MEMBER_LIMIT`, `applyEpisodeAction`, the read service, the feedback writers, the alert handler, the publisher result fields, `PromoteMetricAnomalyToAlertOptions.episodeId`) were written into the index during plan reconciliation (2026-09-22). Compare each row with what this branch actually exports; if the code had to diverge, edit that row in this PR and say so in the PR body. W03 and W04 build against those rows.

- [ ] **Step 2: Typecheck**

```bash
cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288 npx tsc --noEmit -p .; echo exit=$?
cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p .; echo exit=$?
```
Expected: `exit=0` twice. Read the `exit=` line itself. Do not trust a quiet tail.

- [ ] **Step 3: Touched unit tests + static contracts**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run \
  src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.test.ts \
  src/services/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.test.ts \

```
Expected: all green. Check that the reported file count equals the number of files listed (12 for the first command).

- [ ] **Step 4: Integration suites for the touched areas**

```bash
pnpm test-stack up
pnpm --filter @breeze/api test:integration \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeActions.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeIncidents.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeRoutes.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalies.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalySubscriberAdmission.integration.test.ts
pnpm test-stack down
```
Expected: 7 files, all green. W02 adds no table or column, so the tenancy contract suites (`rls-coverage`, `tenantCascade`, export policy) are not re-run here. They belong to W01, and CI runs them regardless.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit the index update and open the PR**

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/monitoring/2026-09-21-metric-anomaly-episodes.md
git commit -m "docs(plans): metric anomaly episodes — W02 contract rows (only if Step 1 changed any)"
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "feat(api): metric anomaly episodes W02 — routes, actions, alert auto-resolve, dispatch per episode" --body-file <body.md>
```

PR body (`body.md`) must contain:
- `Closes #<W02 sub-issue#>`, and a link to the spec and to this plan.
- **Spec deviations D-1…D-9** from the top of this plan, one line each with the file:line evidence.
- **No schema change.** No migration, no new table or column, no cascade or export-policy change (all W01).
- **`alerts.episode_id` untouched.** The anomaly episode id lives only in `alerts.context.episodeId`, because the column is the monitor breach episode (#5290).
- **Label integrity.** The member feedback writer throws inside the request transaction, so an action whose labels cannot be written returns 500 and rolls back. The Task 10 negative control run is recorded.
- **Dispatch behaviour change for the AI pilot.** At most one `anomaly.incident_opened` per episode. Incidents arrive already linked (W01 runs `episodes` before `incidents`), so there is no grace window; an unlinked incident dispatches as before. The counter reads `suppressed` in the publisher log. Task 8's verification output.
- **Still W03's job.** The `anomaly_episode` feedback source type, and excluding `cleared` from the evaluation rates. Until W03, `cleared` members show only in the evaluation's raw status bucket.
- **Still W04's job.** The panel rewrite and the `alertMlContext` deep link to `#anomalies/<episodeId>`.
- **Dismiss of a promoted episode resolves its linked alert by default** (spec §8.1/§8.2, second quorum A7), with note `Resolved: anomaly episode dismissed` unless the tech wrote one; `resolveAlert: false` keeps the alert.
- **A `detection_off` close never resolves a linked alert** — nothing observed the device recover.
- Review round: one independent review (Sonnet). The PR touches alert state and the AI dispatch path, but no tenancy or schema.

Then `complete_wave` only after the PR merges (feature-lifecycle).

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.**
- §8.1 actions and preconditions: Tasks 5 and 6.
- §8.2 cascade `WHERE status='open'`: the Task 5 `cascadeOpenMembers` step, plus its integration test.
- §8.3 per-member feedback with `dedupeKey`/`metadata.episodeId`, and none for automatic closes: Tasks 3 and 5. Task 7 writes no feedback, and Task 10 proves the +17.
- §8.4 `cleared` in legacy enums: W01's, with a guarded fallback in Task 6 Step 3b.
- §7 alert half: Task 7 (never on `detection_off`, A5).
- Second quorum: A7 dismiss resolves the linked alert (Task 5), A9 `deviceLastSeenAt` (Tasks 1–2), A6 no link/grace here (Tasks 8–9).
- §11 link and publisher gate: the link is W01's (incident `episode_id` at insert, A6; Task 8 verifies it), the publisher gate is Task 9.
- §12 list/detail/ref/serialization/`context.episodeId`: Tasks 1, 2, 4 and 6.
- §15 promote `disabled`/`not_found` → 409/404: Tasks 5 and 6.
- §16's W02 tests: all present. That covers the 17-member dismiss and the evaluation +17, promote giving `context.episodeId` with the episode open and members promoted, resolve with a default alert resolve, auto-close resolving the alert, publisher 3→1+2, `ref` by anomaly id, cross-org 404, and 409 on a closed episode.

**Placeholder scan.** The branch name and issue numbers are angle-bracketed tokens that `register_feature`/`start_wave` supply at execution time. Task 7 Step 1 names W01's invoker generically because W01 chooses it. The step says exactly what to check and what shape to produce. No TBD/TODO.

**Type consistency.** These names match across Tasks 1–11: `ApplyEpisodeActionResult.labelledMemberIds`, the route's `meta.labelledMembers` (a count), `EpisodeActionConflict`, `EPISODE_ACTION_CONFLICT_MESSAGES`, `serializeMetricAnomalyEpisode(row, range, now, deviceLastSeenAt?)`, `DEFAULT_EPISODE_DISMISS_NOTE`, `PublishIncidentsResult.suppressed`, `ClaimedIncidentRow.suppressed_by_episode` and `resolveAlertsForAutoClosedEpisodes(orgId, now?)`.
