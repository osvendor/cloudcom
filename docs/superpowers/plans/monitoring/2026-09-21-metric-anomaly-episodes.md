# Metric Anomaly Episodes — Plan Index

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-21-metric-anomaly-episodes-design.md`
(owner asked for plans 2026-09-22; spec sections are cited as §N below and in every wave plan).

One plan document per wave. Each wave is one PR on its own branch
`feature/6650-metric-anomaly-episodes/wave-<sub-issue#>` with `Closes #<sub-issue#>` in the
PR body — except **W01, which ships as three PRs under the one wave issue #6651** (second quorum
A11): branches `…/wave-6651-a`, `…/wave-6651-b`, `…/wave-6651-c` (the wave branch plus a letter
suffix), each cut from `origin/main` once its dependency merged, never stacked; bodies say
`Part of #6651` and the one that merges last is switched to `Closes #6651` before it is enqueued.
State lives on GitHub (feature-lifecycle); the wave issue is the source of truth for status, never
this index.

## Cross-wave interface contract

Every wave plan uses exactly these names. A wave that needs a name not listed here adds it to
this table in the same PR. Reconciled across all four plans on 2026-09-22: the owning wave's plan is
the source of truth for its rows, and later waves conform. The second quorum's amendments A1–A12
(spec §22) were applied to every plan and to this table the same day. Paths are relative to the repo root;
`services/…`, `routes/…`, `jobs/…` are under `apps/api/src/`.

| Name | Where | Defined in | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metricAnomalyEpisodes`, `MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow` | `apps/api/src/db/schema/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts` (re-exported from `schema/index.ts`) | W01 | Drizzle table, columns per spec §4.1 in camelCase; widths `episode_key varchar(200)`, `metric_family varchar(120)`, `peak_metric_name varchar(120)` (W01 dev. 5); `MetricAnomalyEpisodeRow = $inferSelect` — W02 re-exports it, never redefines it |
| `metricAnomalies.episodeId` | `apps/api/src/db/schema/analytics.ts` | W01 | `uuid('episode_id')` nullable, FK → episodes `ON DELETE SET NULL`; indexes `metric_anomalies_episode_id_idx`, `…_unassigned_open_idx`, `…_device_metric_window_idx` |
| `metricAnomalyIncidents.episodeId`, `.suppressedByEpisode` | `apps/api/src/db/schema/metricAnomalyIncidents.ts` | W01 (columns; `episode_id` written at insert by `upsertMetricAnomalyIncidents`), W02 (`suppressed_by_episode` written by the publisher claim) | `uuid` (no FK), `boolean notNull default false`; `episode_id` = episode of the highest-score member, `(array_agg(ma.episode_id ORDER BY ma.score DESC NULLS LAST))[1]`, on conflict `COALESCE(EXCLUDED.episode_id, metric_anomaly_incidents.episode_id)` |
| migration `2026-10-28-100000-metric-anomaly-episodes.sql` | `apps/api/migrations/` | W01 | placeholder name — re-check against `origin/main` at execution (see execution notes); table + RLS + indexes + new columns + `metric_anomalies_status_check` with `cleared`; writes no rows |

| `METRIC_ANOMALY_EPISODE_STATUSES` / `MetricAnomalyEpisodeStatus` | same file | W01 | `['open','resolved','dismissed'] as const` (promotion is a link, not a status) |
| `EPISODE_CLOSE_REASONS` / `EpisodeCloseReason` | same file | W01 | `['cleared','expired_offline','expired_no_data','detection_off','user','snoozed'] as const` — `detection_off` = closed because `ml.anomalies.enabled` was off (A5), never a human label |

| `episodeKeyFor(sourceTable, anomalyType, metricName)`, `EPISODE_METRIC_FAMILIES` | same pair of files | W01 | `→ { episodeKey: string; metricFamily: string; attributionDimension: AttributionDimension \| null }`; unknown metric → `metricFamily = metricName` |
| `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes(range: MetricAnomalyRange)` | `services/metricAnomalyEpisodes.ts` | W01 | `→ Promise<EpisodeCloseResult[]>` = the open episodes it **superseded** and closed; runs inside the `episodes` stage's system context; the stage calls it directly (no wrapper). Locks its live anchors `FOR UPDATE` and writes only to an episode still `open` or a live snoozed successor (A1) |
| `resolveMetricAnomalyEpisodes(orgId: string, rangeTo: Date, now?: Date)` | same file | W01 | `→ Promise<EpisodeCloseResult[]>`; stage `episode-resolve` with detection on, inside a system context; eligible when `last_seen_at + EPISODE_GAP_MINUTES + 5 min <= rangeTo` (the run's `to`, A4); expiry stays `now`-relative |
| `closeEpisodesForDisabledDetection(orgId: string, now?: Date)` | same file | W01 | `→ Promise<EpisodeCloseResult[]>`; stage `episode-resolve` with `ml.anomalies.enabled` off (A5): every open episode → `resolved` / `detection_off`, members `open` → `cleared`, no feedback |

| `EpisodeCloseHandler`, `setEpisodeCloseHandler(fn)`, `notifyEpisodesClosed(orgId, closed)` | same file | W01 declares (no-op default), W02 registers | `(orgId: string, closed: EpisodeCloseResult[]) => Promise<void>`; `setEpisodeCloseHandler(fn: EpisodeCloseHandler \| null)` (`null` restores the no-op); `notifyEpisodesClosed` never throws (logs + Sentry). **Call site:** once per `detectMetricAnomaliesRange`, after the stage loop, with the closes of every *completed* `episodes` and `episode-resolve` stage — after both transactions commit, outside any DB context |

| `listDeviceEpisodes`, `getDeviceEpisodeDto`, `getDeviceEpisodeDetail`, `serializeMetricAnomalyEpisode`, `EPISODE_CLOSED_WINDOW_DAYS` | `services/metricAnomalyEpisodeQueries.ts` | W02 | read side of §12, scoped by `(org_id, device_id)`; ambient request context |

Runs on the request transaction; `FOR UPDATE` on the episode first; private `resolveEpisode` / `dismissEpisode` are where W03 adds its row. Conflicts: `episode_closed`, `already_promoted`, `not_snoozed`, `no_promotable_member`, `promotion_disabled` |
| `emitMlFeedbackEvents(inputs, database?)`, `ML_FEEDBACK_BATCH_SIZE` | `services/mlFeedback.ts` | W02 | `→ Promise<{ inserted: number }>`; requires `dedupeKey` on every event; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the semantic unique; **throws** (never best-effort) |

| `PromoteMetricAnomalyToAlertOptions.episodeId` | `services/metricAnomalyPromotion.ts` | W02 | written to `alerts.context.episodeId` only — **never** `alerts.episode_id` (that column is the monitor-breach episode, #5290) |
| `registerEpisodeCloseAlertHandler()`, `handleEpisodesClosed`, `resolveAlertsForAutoClosedEpisodes(orgId, now?)`, `autoResolveNoteFor`, `EPISODE_ALERT_CATCHUP_HOURS` | `services/metricAnomalyEpisodeAlerts.ts` | W02 | registered in `initializeMetricAnomaliesWorker`; re-derives work from the DB (auto-closed `cleared`/`expired_*` ≤ 24 h — never `detection_off` —, alert `active`, not `requires_human`); notes `Auto-resolved: anomaly episode cleared` / `… expired`; opens its own `withSystemDbAccessContext` |
| `PublishIncidentsResult.suppressed`, `ClaimedIncidentRow.suppressed_by_episode` | `jobs/metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts` | W02 | claim publishes at most one incident per episode, marks the rest `suppressed_by_episode` + dispatched; unlinked incidents dispatch as before (no grace window — W01 links at insert) |
| episode integration fixtures (`seedTenant`, `enableAnomalyDetection`, `insertEpisodeDevice`, `seedEpisode`, `seedAlert`, `seedIncident`, `insertCleanRollups`) | `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/metricAnomalyEpisodeFixtures.ts` | W02 | helper module (not a test); W03 reuses it |
| migration `2026-10-28-110000-ml-feedback-anomaly-episode-source.sql` | `apps/api/migrations/` | W03 | placeholder — must sort after W01's final name and `origin/main`; re-creates `ml_feedback_events_source_type_check` with `anomaly_episode`; writes no rows |
| `'anomaly_episode'`, `'anomaly_episode.dismissed'`, `'anomaly_episode.resolved'` | `ML_FEEDBACK_SOURCE_TYPES`, `ML_FEEDBACK_EVENT_TYPES` in `packages/shared/src/validators/mlFeedback.ts` | W03 | new source type + the only two episode-level event types (promote/unsnooze never emit one) |

| evaluation response additions | `routes/analytics.ts` `GET /analytics/anomalies/evaluation` | W03 | additive: `status.cleared` (excluded from `total` and every rate), `episodes: { total; byStatus{open,resolved,dismissed}; byCloseReason{cleared,expired_offline,expired_no_data,detection_off,user,snoozed}; medianDurationSeconds: number \| null; recurrenceShare; humanLabelledShare }` — `humanLabelledShare` = closed episodes with `close_reason = 'user'` or `linked_alert_id` set ÷ closed episodes except `snoozed` (A8); `feedback` still counts `sourceType = 'anomaly'` only |
| `formatEpisodeSentence(episode, t)`, `EpisodeSentenceInput` | `apps/web/src/components/devices/anomalyEpisodeSentence.ts` | W04 | `→ { headline: string; attributionLine: string }`; input = `Pick<MetricAnomalyEpisodeDto, …>` + attribution (a full DTO is assignable); null range → peak value |
| `AnomalyEpisodeCard` (`onChanged`, `onStale`), `AnomalyEpisodeMembers` | `apps/web/src/components/devices/` | W04 | card consumes W02's DTO and PATCH envelope; 409 → `onStale()` → panel refetch; remediation keyed on `peakAnomalyId`; detections chip = `bucketCount`; members read `{ data: MetricAnomalyEpisodeDetailDto }`; closed chip reads `deviceLastSeenAt` for `expired_offline` and has a `detection_off` label; the panel polls every 60 s while an open episode is visible and falls back to the legacy row for an unresolved `ref` (A9) |
| `MetricAnomalyAlertContext.episodeId`, `anomalyDeepLinkHash(context)` | `apps/web/src/components/alerts/alertMlContext.ts` | W04 | `#anomalies/<episodeId>` when W02's `context.episodeId` exists, else `#anomalies/<anomalyId>`; the panel passes either as `ref` and rings `focusedEpisodeId` |

## Accepted deviations from the spec

Each plan carries its own deviation table with evidence; all are **accepted** as of plan
reconciliation (2026-09-22). One line each:

**W01**
1. Assembly also closes: an open episode superseded by a new island > gap later is closed (`cleared` with ≥ 6 clean buckets per metric before the new island, else `expired_no_data`); backfill orphans and older islands are created already closed.
2. The gap is measured end-to-start in both directions (lower bound 5 min more lenient than the spec).
3. A live snoozed successor is an attach target, so a burst that continues while snoozed builds one silent episode, not one per tick.
4. `bucket_count` = distinct `window_start`s, not member rows (the ram/cpu pairs write two rows per bucket).
5. Column widths: `metric_family varchar(120)`, `episode_key varchar(200)`, `peak_metric_name varchar(120)`.
6. Growth rows (`memory_growth`, `disk_growth`) are not used for baseline exclusion.
7. Alert resolve on auto-close is W02's handler; W01 ships a no-op.
8. `assembleMetricAnomalyEpisodes` returns `Promise<EpisodeCloseResult[]>` (its supersedes).
9. `scan-orgs` also selects orgs that own an open episode (orgs with no live device still get `episode-resolve`); the flag gate moves inside `detectMetricAnomaliesRange`.
10. Stage order `baseline, growth-trend, process-runaway, episodes, incidents, episode-resolve`, then the optional `v1-shadow` (second quorum A6: assembly before incidents so each incident is born linked).
11. Flag-off result shape `{ statements: 0, skipped: true, skippedReason: 'ml-disabled', stages: [episode-resolve], episodesClosed }`; that stage closes every open episode as `detection_off` (A5).
12. Episodes closed by assembly — historical ones and superseded open ones — get `resolved_at` = start of the next island (historical ones do not appear under "Recently closed"; the episode-relative recurrence window counts a superseded predecessor); snoozed successors keep `resolved_at = now()`.
13. `metric_anomaly_baseline_fallback_total` gains a `detector` label.

**W02**
- D-1 Publisher suppresses on a sibling already published or with an agent run, and allows one incident per episode per claim batch.
- D-2 *(withdrawn by the second quorum, A6)* — the publisher grace window for unlinked incidents is gone; W01 links incidents at insert.
- D-3 Episode routes live on the existing `anomaliesRoutes`, not a new `anomalyEpisodesRoutes` module.
- D-4 `unsnooze` clears the snooze on every snoozed episode of the same (device, key).
- D-5 Promote targets the highest-score `open`/`promoted` member; feedback goes to rows that end up `promoted`.
- D-6 `rangeMin`/`rangeMax` are taken over members of the peak metric only.
- D-7 Per-member feedback is written by a throwing batch writer inside the request transaction.
- D-8 The close handler runs after the stage transactions commit, outside any DB context (W01's call site), and re-derives its work from the DB.
- D-9 The DTO adds `peakAnomalyId` so the web card can key remediation suggestions on a real anomaly id.
- Note: `alerts.episode_id` is the monitor-breach episode (#5290); the anomaly episode id goes only into `alerts.context.episodeId`.

**W03**
1. Episode-level rows use new event types `anomaly_episode.dismissed|resolved`; only resolve/dismiss emit one (spec §8.3 said "one row per action"; promote and unsnooze never close an episode).
2. The `episodes` evaluation block's fields are defined by W03 (spec named the need, not the shape).
3. Route line numbers follow the current tree (`analytics.ts:1090-1334`).
4. The episode-level row uses W02's throwing writer inside the action transaction and is counted apart from `feedbackInserted` and the evaluation `feedback` block.

**W04**
1. "N detections" is `bucketCount` (distinct buckets); the member table shows a Metric column because pairs write two rows per bucket.
2. Remediation suggestions key on `peakAnomalyId`, not the episode id.
3. The Open / Recently closed / All filter lives in component state, not the URL hash (`#anomalies/<id>` already carries the focus target).
4. Second-quorum states (A9): 60 s silent poll while an open episode is visible, legacy read-only row for a `ref` W02 cannot resolve, "device not seen since" / "detection turned off" chips.

## Execution notes that apply to every wave

- **Migration names** are chosen at execution time against `origin/main`, never from a stale
  worktree: `git ls-tree --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations/ | sort | tail -1`, then pick
  a `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-` prefix that sorts after it. On 2026-09-22 the newest was
  `2026-10-27-120000-partner-notify-on-behalf-acceptance.sql`, so the plans use `2026-10-28-100000`
  (W01a) and `2026-10-28-110000` (W03); rename if main has moved past them. W03's file must also
  sort after W01's *final* name. Both plans carry this re-check as a step; the pre-push guard
  (`check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main`) enforces it again.
- **Contract suites need a live DB** (`pnpm test-stack up`; `pnpm test-stack down` when done).
  W01a (the table and column PR) and W03 must run the integration + `test:rls-coverage` suites
  locally before opening the PR; W01b and W01c run the integration suites they can break.
- **Codex was at its usage limit** when this was written (until 2026-09-26); drivers are Claude
  subagents. Review per CLAUDE.md: one independent round; W01 is tenancy/migration so it gets a
  Sonnet or Opus reviewer per PR (W01a tenancy/migration, W01b concurrency with human actions, W01c
  detector behaviour).
