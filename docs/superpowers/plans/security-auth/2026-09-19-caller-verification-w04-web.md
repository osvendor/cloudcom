# Caller Verification W04: Technician Web Workflow — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Let technicians verify a caller from tickets, contacts, devices, and structured AI refusals; inspect single-use grants, bindings, destinations and fences; manage partner/org policy; and obtain an administrative-disable grant through interactive MFA. Every surface remains hidden until the server enables enforcement.

**Architecture:** One typed, `runAction`-backed client owns transport. A runtime readiness hook gates mounting, including data fetching. A reusable modal separates requester/action selection, server-computed method availability, and challenge monitoring. Ticket badges use server freshness, not the challenge expiry. Contacts gain a verification drawer alongside their existing inline editor. Policy forms consume the server baseline, effective provenance and ignored overrides. Administrative step-up reuses the existing ceremony with an injectable mutation transport. AI errors offer an inline verification workflow without replaying an action.

**Tech Stack:** Astro + React islands, TypeScript, Zustand, react-i18next, existing Dialog/Drawer primitives, Vitest + Testing Library, Hono API contracts supplied by W01–W03 and W05.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/security-auth/2026-09-18-caller-verification-design.md` v5: D2, D4, D6, D11–D16; “Tiers and the establishment rule,” “Administrative disable,” authenticated “API,” “Web UI,” web “Testing,” W04, and all Review notes explaining those contracts. Cross-wave authority: `docs/superpowers/plans/security-auth/2026-09-19-caller-verification.md`, especially its exact TypeScript interfaces and permission gates.

## Global Constraints

- Execution of this document is future product work. The authoring request creates only this plan; it does not execute any implementation, test-stack, commit or PR command below.
- W04 depends on W01 and merges after W02/W03. W05 owns the administrative endpoint, step-up operation, enforcement adapters and enabling the flag. Keep `CALLER_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=false` throughout W04. Test responses may enable it; production configuration may not.
- Readiness comes from existing `GET /config` (`apps/api/src/routes/config.ts:19–29`), not a build-time public env variable. W01 must add `features.callerVerification` using its `isCallerVerificationEnabled(): boolean`. No new readiness route is necessary. Missing, false, failed and not-yet-loaded config all hide the feature.
- Preserve index names: `callerVerifications`, `callerVerificationSubjectBindings`, `callerVerificationDestinations`, `callerVerificationPolicies`; SQL tables `caller_verifications`, `caller_verification_subject_bindings`, `caller_verification_destinations`, `caller_verification_policies`. Enum names remain `callerVerificationMethodEnum`, `callerVerificationStatusEnum`, `callerVerificationActionScopeEnum`, `callerVerificationBindingSourceEnum`, `callerVerificationDestinationKindEnum`, `callerVerificationDestinationSourceEnum`.
- W04 creates no tables or migrations. All new tenant tables must have RLS enabled + forced + policies in the creating migration. Composite FKs carrying `org_id` must be `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`. Migrations are idempotent, contain no inner `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, and DML migrations start with `SELECT set_config('breeze.scope','system',true);`, with recorded DML row counts. Never name a column `device_id`/`ticket_id` on the new tables: correlation uses `workstation_device_ref`, `ticket_ref`, `consumed_intent_ref`.
- Reserved migrations remain `2026-10-15-180000-caller-verification-tables.sql`, `2026-10-15-180100-caller-verification-policies.sql`, `2026-10-15-180200-caller-verification-destinations-backfill.sql` (W01) and `2026-10-15-180300-action-intents-caller-target.sql` (W05). Re-check `ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1` before every commit and rename upward if main overtakes an unshipped migration. That literal command currently prints the `preflight` directory; also use `git ls-files 'apps/api/migrations/*.sql' | sort | tail -1` to inspect actual SQL. Never rename shipped history. Sweep path references after any unshipped rename.
- W01 owns cascade/export/merge/RLS registrations: all four tables in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` and `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`; bindings custom merge, verifications/destinations repoint, policies keep-survivor; policy in `DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES` and `XOR_OWNERSHIP_DUAL_AXIS_TABLES`. Do not weaken those contracts to make a web test pass.
- View permissions are `ORGS_READ`; mutations require `ORGS_WRITE` + MFA and server contact/site reach. Partner writes require `canManagePartnerWidePolicies(auth)`. Browser controls are convenience, never the authorization boundary. Derive partner ownership from the session; never post a selected partner ID.
- Every new web POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, including passkey options and grant minting, runs inside `runAction`. Add guarded files to `no-silent-mutations.test.ts`; do not touch `runActionAllowlist.ts` or add exemption markers. Use `handleActionError` so 401 redirects and already-toasted failures are not duplicated.
- `fetchWithAuth` injects `orgId` (`apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:1298`, `applyOrgId`). For path-scoped calls explicitly include the same org in the request query so a different active global org cannot be injected. API query arguments are transport parameters, not transient page state.
- UI navigation state lives in `window.location.hash`, never query parameters. Use `useHashState` for SSR-safe reads (`apps/web/src/lib/useHashState.ts:47`). Keep match numbers, reverse codes, reasons, factors and grant IDs only in memory, never hashes, storage or logs.
- The index/v5 D4 wins over stale prose saying unbound workstation is tier 2: it is tier 1. `administrative_stepup` is not a challenge method. Never infer binding from a username, contact email, `isPrimary`, or device selection. The server re-evaluates tier at release.
- `expiresAt` is challenge expiry; it is not grant freshness. Use server `usableUntil`, `isFresh`, `isConsumed`. Do not claim “by you” for another technician's row. Late rejection can supersede a previously verified row; keep refreshing visible status.
- Every new string belongs in `callerVerification.json` with real translations in en, de-DE, es-419, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, pt-BR, tr-TR. Namespace registration is automatic (`apps/web/src/lib/i18n/index.ts:20–35`). Update the eight-locale parity and seven translated-locale duplicate-baseline contracts, not their thresholds.
- Branch: `feature/<parent#>-caller-verification/wave-<sub#>`; PR body: `Closes #<sub#>`. These are issue-number metavariables required by the feature index; obtain the actual numbers from the implementation wave issue. Do not invent tracking numbers or register issues during plan authoring.
- Commands below run from repository root unless enclosed in a subshell. API: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`; web: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run <path>`. Integration requires `pnpm test-stack up` / `pnpm test-stack down`. No watch-mode passthrough, wildcard CLI filters, or assumption that unit tests include RLS suites.

**HTTP acceptance contract (exercised by Task 1), not existing backend code.** No caller-verification API/service implementation exists in this checkout. Sibling plans appeared during authoring: W01 Task 14 uses `{data: ...}` envelopes (including start/get/history/policy), and W05 carries the full index refusal payload inside `requiresCallerVerification`; the client below consumes those actual shapes. The legacy org-contact list remains `{data, pagination}` and is not unwrapped. W01 must expose the additive web projections below in its planned `apps/api/src/routes/callerVerification.ts`, beside the index-defined routes. The index service signatures stay verbatim. W01 also adds the field to existing `routes/config.ts:22`. W05 must extend `routes/auth/schemas.ts:148,179`, `routes/auth/mfa.ts:1209,1344` and `services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts` for the administrative operation. Do not implement these backend responsibilities in this wave or enable its UI before they are delivered.

1. Verification reads/start/cancel/attest/admin return the unchanged `VerificationView` fields plus `remainingAttempts`, `undeliverableReason`, `incidentId`, `usableUntil`, `consumedAction`, and, when W05 lands, `consumedIntentStatus`. Keep the index `VerificationView` unchanged; `VerificationDetails` is its additive HTTP projection. Start (202), get, cancel, attest, administrative creation (201), every history row and the ticket row use W01’s five-field projection under `{data: ...}`. W05 extends that projection with `consumedIntentStatus`; accept its absence before W05 as unknown, never as success or failure. W01 owns the HTTP projection, including the server attempt count, freshness and delivery reason; W05 retains it and supplies incident/consumption state. Resolve `consumedAction` from the consumed intent's `actionName` and `consumedIntentStatus` from its `status`, joined by `consumed_intent_ref` within the authorized org. The existing `apps/api/src/db/schema/actionIntents.ts` defines the status union below. Missing/erased/unreachable intents project null; never infer failure from consumption or return raw outbound errors. `consumedAt` remains authoritative even with a null intent projection. Task 1 tests all seven response surfaces; Tasks 5/6 consume failure without replaying an action. W05 owns the real release/outbound-failure test (failed intent, retained consumption and dispatch marker, refusal for another intent); web fixtures do not establish that backend behavior.
2. History adds bindings/destinations with establishment state; policy GET/PUT return `{data:{row,defaults,baseline,effective}}` for both owners. `defaults` is the built-in policy; `baseline` is the resolved partner policy before org tightening (including on the partner response), never the org effective policy. This makes an org's numeric/boolean/set bounds expressible without confusing its own tightening with the partner floor.
3. The spec mentions fence override but omits its route-table row; use `POST /orgs/:orgId/contacts/:contactId/caller-verifications/fence-override` with `{reason}`. Callback `attest` likewise needs `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/:id/attest` with `{note}`. These call the index's existing `fenceOverride` / `attest` functions, with normal org/site/MFA checks.
4. No M365 HTTP user-search endpoint exists. The safe existing Graph read is `executeM365ReadAction(auth: AuthContext, action: M365ReadAction, inputOrgId?: string, auditRequest?: RequestLike): Promise<M365ReadActionServiceResult>` (`apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/readActionService.ts:103`). `aiToolsM365.ts:391` uses `{type:'m365.user.list',search,pageSize:25}`; projection fields are in `packages/shared/src/m365/readActions.ts:26`. W01 adds `GET /orgs/:orgId/caller-verification-directory-users?search=` returning `{data: DirectorySearch}` with the DTO below, backed by that read and the same verified `customer-graph-read` connection's tenant. The route reports unavailable without that connection; direct Graph has exact-user lookup only (`m365DirectGraph.ts:226`), and there is no existing three-backend search to reuse. Recheck tenant after the read; do not accept a browser-entered tenant/OID. This route is flag/ORGS_READ gated and rejects site-restricted readers because Graph users have no site axis. W04 surfaces that error and offers no stale binding candidates. It returns no verifier data.
5. W02's corrected device-suggestions route must return `{data: await deviceSuggestions(...)}` (the reviewed `{devices: ...}` producer bug is not an alternate supported envelope). Preserve `deviceId`, `hostname`, `username`, `hasBinding`, `available`, and optional `unavailableReason: 'helper_outdated'` verbatim. Task 1 feeds that HTTP envelope through the real browser client and through the modal's combined load; Task 4 rejects unavailable or missing selected devices even when aggregate workstation readiness is true. Method availability stays the index shape. The browser may lower an estimate for an unbound selection; it must never raise a server-returned tier.

### Task 1: Typed API client and cross-wave projection contract

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/testFixtures.ts`. Modify `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts:36,540`.

**Interfaces:** Consumes the index's `VerificationView`, `MethodAvailability`, `EffectiveCallerVerificationPolicy`, `StartInput` shapes, and `fetchWithAuth(path: string, options?: FetchWithAuthOptions): Promise<Response>`. Produces the following exported browser types and client functions; do not import server runtime code into a React bundle.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing transport test.**

```ts
// apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { startVerification, cancelVerification, getVerification } from './callerVerification';
import * as api from './callerVerification';
import { ORG, CONTACT, row, policy, history, TARGET } from '@/components/callerVerification/testFixtures';
const mocks = vi.hoisted(() => ({ fetch: vi.fn(), toast: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('@/stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: mocks.fetch }));
vi.mock('@/components/shared/Toast', () => ({ showToast: mocks.toast }));
beforeEach(() => { vi.clearAllMocks(); mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: row }))); });
it('starts with the exact body and explicit path org, accepting 202', async () => {
  mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: row }), { status: 202 }));
  await startVerification({ orgId: ORG, contactId: CONTACT, actionScope: 'reset_password', method: 'sms' });
  const [url, init] = mocks.fetch.mock.calls[0];
  expect(url).toBe(`/orgs/${ORG}/caller-verifications?orgId=${ORG}`);
  expect(JSON.parse(init.body)).toEqual({ contactId: CONTACT, actionScope: 'reset_password', method: 'sms' });
  expect(init.method).toBe('POST');
  expect(mocks.toast).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'success' }));
});
it('does not turn an HTTP-200 application failure into success', async () => {
  mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response('{"success":false,"error":"contact_fenced"}'));
  await expect(cancelVerification(ORG, row.id)).rejects.toMatchObject({ status: 200 });
  expect(mocks.toast).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'error' }));
});
it('reads the scoped verification with abort support', async () => {
  const signal = new AbortController().signal;
  await getVerification(ORG, row.id, signal);
  expect(mocks.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.stringContaining(`/caller-verifications/${row.id}?orgId=${ORG}`), expect.objectContaining({ method: 'GET', signal }));
});
```

Append these HTTP contracts to the same test file. They use the real browser client with JSON `Response` objects, not mocked client methods. These are the corrected W01/W02 wire shapes; do not accept the defective `{devices}` or incomplete policy responses to make the tests pass.

```ts
it('unwraps W02 suggestions and retains individual readiness', async () => {
  const devices: api.DeviceSuggestion[] = [
    { deviceId: row.id, hostname: 'Ready', username: 'ada', hasBinding: true, available: true },

  ];
  mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: devices })));
  const signal = new AbortController().signal;
  expect(await api.deviceSuggestions(ORG, CONTACT, signal)).toEqual(devices);
  expect(mocks.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`/orgs/${ORG}/caller-verifications/device-suggestions?contactId=${CONTACT}&orgId=${ORG}`, expect.objectContaining({ signal }));
  mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ devices })));
  await expect(api.deviceSuggestions(ORG, CONTACT)).rejects.toThrow('Missing API data envelope');

Create deterministic fixtures (all following tests import these rather than invent partial API rows):

```ts
// apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/testFixtures.ts
import type { VerificationDetails, EffectiveCallerVerificationPolicy, ContactHistory } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
export const ORG = '11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111';
export const CONTACT = '22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222';
export const TARGET = '33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333';
export const USER = '44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444';
export const row: VerificationDetails = {
  id: '55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555555', orgId: ORG, contactId: CONTACT,
  targetContactId: CONTACT, method: 'sms', status: 'pending', tier: 2,

  remainingAttempts: 2, usableUntil: null, incidentId: null, consumedAction: null, consumedIntentStatus: null, undeliverableReason: null,
};
export const policy: EffectiveCallerVerificationPolicy = {
  requiredTierResetPassword: 2, requiredTierDisableUser: 2, disableUserAuthorizerRoles: ['admin'],
  verificationTtlMinutes: 30, allowedMethods: ['workstation', 'sms', 'email', 'callback_attestation'],
  workstationTimeoutSeconds: 120, destinationMinAgeDays: 7, requireAttestedDestination: false,
  requireTicket: false, allowCrossTechnicianUse: false, allowAdministrativeDisable: true,
  maxAttemptsPerHour: 3, coolingOffHours: 24, provenance: {}, ignored: [],
};
export const history: ContactHistory = { rows: [], fencedUntil: null, bindings: [], destinations: [] };
```

Register `'src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts'` in `TARGET_GLOBS`. Increase the existing expected count 125 to 126 only after counting the rebased list; do not alter the allowlist. Additional component registrations happen in Task 15.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts` → all tests pass. Full mutation guard runs after all listed new modules exist.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/testFixtures.ts apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): caller verification API contract and mutation feedback"
```

### Task 2: Runtime readiness and dark mounting

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/stores/featuresStore.ts:6,36,70` and `apps/web/src/stores/featuresStore.test.ts`. Create `apps/web/src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.test.tsx`.

**Interfaces:** Consumes `GET /config → {features:{callerVerification:boolean}}` from W01. Produces `useCallerVerificationEnabled(): boolean`, false on SSR and until loaded.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing tests.**

```tsx
import { act, renderHook, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { useFeaturesStore } from '@/stores/featuresStore';
import { useCallerVerificationEnabled } from './useCallerVerificationEnabled';
const fetch = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn());
vi.mock('@/stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: fetch }));
beforeEach(() => { useFeaturesStore.setState({ loaded: false, features: { billing: false, support: false, aiOperatorTasks: false, callerVerification: false } }); });
it.each([{}, { callerVerification: false }, { callerVerification: 'true' }])('fails closed for %j', async features => {
  fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ features })));
  const { result } = renderHook(useCallerVerificationEnabled);
  await waitFor(() => expect(useFeaturesStore.getState().loaded).toBe(true));
  expect(result.current).toBe(false);
});
it('opens only after the true runtime flag and closes on reset', async () => {
  fetch.mockResolvedValue(new Response('{"features":{"callerVerification":true}}'));
  const { result } = renderHook(useCallerVerificationEnabled);
  expect(result.current).toBe(false);
  await waitFor(() => expect(result.current).toBe(true));
  act(() => useFeaturesStore.setState({ loaded: false }));
  expect(result.current).toBe(false);
});
it('hides on config failure', async () => {
  fetch.mockRejectedValue(new Error('offline'));
  const { result } = renderHook(useCallerVerificationEnabled);
  await waitFor(() => expect(useFeaturesStore.getState().loaded).toBe(true));
  expect(result.current).toBe(false);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.test.tsx` → module absent.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Add `callerVerification: boolean` to `Features`, `callerVerification: false` to `DEFAULT_FEATURES`, and `callerVerification: data.features?.callerVerification === true` to parsed features. Update existing complete feature literals in `featuresStore.test.ts` with false. W01's config projection is `callerVerification: isCallerVerificationEnabled(),` inside the existing `features` object; this is a prerequisite, not a second flag implementation.

```ts
// apps/web/src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFeaturesStore } from '@/stores/featuresStore';
export function useCallerVerificationEnabled(): boolean {
  const enabled = useFeaturesStore(s => s.features.callerVerification);
  const loaded = useFeaturesStore(s => s.loaded);
  const load = useFeaturesStore(s => s.load);
  useEffect(() => { void load(); }, [load]);
  return loaded && enabled === true;
}
```

Use a gated outer component and a data-fetching inner component throughout this plan; returning null after running fetching effects does not satisfy dark mounting. No caller-verification route may be fetched while this hook is false.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.test.tsx src/stores/featuresStore.test.ts` → pass, including old config fixtures.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/stores/featuresStore.ts apps/web/src/stores/featuresStore.test.ts apps/web/src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.ts apps/web/src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): hide caller verification until runtime readiness"
```

### Task 3: Complete eight-locale namespace before building the UI

**Files:** Create the eight exact `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/callerVerification.json` paths listed in File structure and `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/callerVerification.test.ts`. Modify `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts:15` (each locale's baseline object).

**Interfaces:** Consumes automatic namespace loading from `lib/i18n/index.ts:20`. Produces all keys in the catalog matrix below; dot-separated keys become nested JSON objects. Dynamic key calls must use the existing `/* i18n-dynamic */` marker (`keyUsage.test.ts:11`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing locale test.**

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { expect, it } from 'vitest';
const locales = ['en', 'de-DE', 'es-419', 'fr-CA', 'fr-FR', 'it-IT', 'pt-BR', 'tr-TR'];
const leaves = (o: Record<string, unknown>, prefix = ''): [string, string][] => Object.entries(o).flatMap(([k, v]) => typeof v === 'object' && v !== null ? leaves(v as Record<string, unknown>, `${prefix}${k}.`) : [[`${prefix}${k}`, String(v)]]);
it('ships the complete namespace and preserves interpolation in all locales', () => {
  const catalogs = locales.map(l => new Map(leaves(JSON.parse(readFileSync(new URL(`../../locales/${l}/callerVerification.json`, import.meta.url), 'utf8')))));
  const tokens = (s: string) => [...s.matchAll(/{{(\w+)}}/g)].map(m => m[1]).sort();
  for (const catalog of catalogs) {
    expect([...catalog.keys()].sort()).toEqual([...catalogs[0].keys()].sort());
    for (const [key, value] of catalogs[0]) expect(tokens(catalog.get(key)!)).toEqual(tokens(value));
  }
  expect(catalogs[0].get('script')).toContain("If anything on it looks wrong");
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/i18n/callerVerification.test.ts` → ENOENT for the new catalog.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write these real translations.** The matrix is executable input to the following script, not instructions to translate later. French Canadian “courriel” and French “e-mail” are intentionally distinct. Labels describe assurance without promising identity proof.

locales = [cell.strip() for cell in lines[0].split('|')[2:-1]]
catalogs = {locale: {} for locale in locales}
for line in lines[2:]:
    cells = [cell.strip() for cell in line.split('|')[1:-1]]
    assert len(cells) == 9, cells[0]
    for locale, value in zip(locales, cells[1:]):
        target = catalogs[locale]
        parts = cells[0].split('.')
        for part in parts[:-1]:
            target = target.setdefault(part, {})
        target[parts[-1]] = value
for locale, catalog in catalogs.items():
    Path(f'apps/web/src/locales/{locale}/callerVerification.json').write_text(json.dumps(catalog, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2) + '\n')
```

Add `'callerVerification.json': 0,` to each of the seven `namespaceDuplicateBaselines` objects. The matrix intentionally has zero exact-English duplicates outside en. No index.ts namespace edit is needed. CONTACT_ROLES labels reuse `settings:contactsCard.roles.*`, already translated for all seven valid roles.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/i18n/callerVerification.test.ts src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts` → exact key/token parity and zero duplicate growth.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/locales/*/callerVerification.json apps/web/src/lib/i18n/callerVerification.test.ts apps/web/src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): translate caller verification in all eight locales"
```

### Task 4: Requester picker and action/method selection modal

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.test.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx` in that same directory; also create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.transport.test.tsx`. Reference `apps/web/src/components/devices/ManualAssetModal.tsx:161–195,560–595` (inline contact picker), `apps/api/src/routes/orgContacts.ts:46–54,250–275` (paged list, no search parameter).

**Interfaces:** Consumes `contactsPage`, `methodsForContact`, `deviceSuggestions`, `getPolicy`, `startVerification`. Produces `ContactPicker({orgId,value,onChange,label}): ReactNode` and `VerifyCallerModal(props: VerifyCallerModalProps): ReactNode`. There is no reusable existing contact-picker component; create this smallest reusable addition without rewriting ManualAssetModal.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing component tests using real i18n, matching ContactsCard.test.tsx and MaintenanceModeDialog.test.tsx.**

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import * as api from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
import { VerifyCallerModal } from './VerifyCallerModal';
import { ORG, CONTACT, TARGET, row, policy } from './testFixtures';
vi.mock('@/lib/api/callerVerification');
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  vi.mocked(api.contactsPage).mockResolvedValue({ data: [{ id: CONTACT, name: 'Ada', email: null, siteId: null, roles: ['admin'] }, { id: TARGET, name: 'Grace', email: null, siteId: null, roles: [] }], pagination: { page: 1, total: 2, limit: 100 } });
  vi.mocked(api.getPolicy).mockResolvedValue({ row: null, defaults: policy, baseline: policy, effective: policy });
  vi.mocked(api.deviceSuggestions).mockResolvedValue([]);
  vi.mocked(api.methodsForContact).mockResolvedValue([{ method: 'sms', available: true, tier: 2, reason: 'destination_established' }, { method: 'workstation', available: false, tier: 1, reason: 'unbound_principal', unavailableReason: 'helper_outdated' }]);
  vi.mocked(api.startVerification).mockResolvedValue(row);
});
it('shows server tiers and the disabled-method reason', async () => {
  render(<VerifyCallerModal orgId={ORG} initialContactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-next'));
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('cv-method-sms')).toHaveTextContent('Assurance tier 2');
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-method-workstation')).toBeDisabled();
  expect(screen.getByText('The desktop helper needs an update.')).toBeVisible();
});
it('pins a different target only for disable_user and resets it when action changes', async () => {
  render(<VerifyCallerModal orgId={ORG} initialContactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  fireEvent.change(await screen.findByTestId('cv-action'), { target: { value: 'disable_user' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-different-target'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-target').querySelector(`option[value="${TARGET}"]`)).not.toBeNull());
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-target'), { target: { value: TARGET } });
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-action'), { target: { value: 'reset_password' } });
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-next'));
  fireEvent.click(await screen.findByTestId('cv-method-sms'));
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ contactId: CONTACT, actionScope: 'reset_password' })));
  expect(vi.mocked(api.startVerification).mock.calls[0][0].targetContactId).toBeUndefined();
});
```

Add a separate file using the real Task-1 client so the three-response modal load cannot pass with a mocked-away envelope defect:

```tsx
// VerifyCallerModal.transport.test.tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';

vi.mock('@/components/shared/Toast', () => ({ showToast: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
afterEach(cleanup);
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  mocks.fetch.mockImplementation(async (path: string, init: RequestInit = {}) => {
    const url = new URL(path, 'https://breeze.example.test');
    expect(url.searchParams.get('orgId')).toBe(ORG);
    let body: unknown;
    if (init.method === 'POST') body = { data: row };
    else if (url.pathname.endsWith('/device-suggestions')) body = { data: [

    else if (url.pathname.endsWith('/contacts')) body = { data: [{ id: CONTACT, name: 'Ada', email: null, siteId: null, roles: [] }], pagination: { page: 1, total: 1, limit: 100 } };
    else throw new Error(`Unexpected request: ${path}`);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(body), { status: init.method === 'POST' ? 202 : 200 });
  });
});
it.each([TARGET, row.id])('blocks unavailable or missing preselected device %s despite aggregate readiness', async deviceId => {
  render(<VerifyCallerModal orgId={ORG} initialContactId={CONTACT} deviceId={deviceId} initialMethod="workstation" onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-next'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-method-workstation')).toBeEnabled();
  expect(screen.getByRole('option', { name: /Old helper/ })).toBeDisabled();
  expect(screen.getByRole('option', { name: /Old helper/ })).toHaveTextContent('The desktop helper needs an update.');
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-username'), { target: { value: 'ada' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')).toBeDisabled();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start'));
  expect(mocks.fetch.mock.calls.some(([, init]) => init?.method === 'POST')).toBe(false);
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-device'), { target: { value: USER } });
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username')).not.toBeChecked();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')).toBeEnabled();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(mocks.fetch.mock.calls.filter(([, init]) => init?.method === 'POST')).toHaveLength(1));
  const [, init] = mocks.fetch.mock.calls.find(([, init]) => init?.method === 'POST')!;
  expect(JSON.parse(init.body)).toMatchObject({ contactId: CONTACT, deviceId: USER, username: 'ada' });
});
```

`ContactPicker.test.tsx` adds a paginated-selection regression:

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { contactsPage } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
import { ContactPicker } from './ContactPicker';
import { ORG, CONTACT } from './testFixtures';
vi.mock('@/lib/api/callerVerification');
it('loads a later page and returns the canonical contact id', async () => {
  vi.mocked(contactsPage).mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: [], pagination: { page: 1, total: 101, limit: 100 } }).mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: [{ id: CONTACT, name: 'Ada', email: null, siteId: null, roles: [] }], pagination: { page: 2, total: 101, limit: 100 } });
  const change = vi.fn(); render(<ContactPicker orgId={ORG} value="" onChange={change} label="Caller" />);
  fireEvent.click(await screen.findByText('Load more contacts'));
  await screen.findByText('Ada');
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Caller'), { target: { value: CONTACT } });
  expect(change).toHaveBeenCalledWith(CONTACT);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.transport.test.tsx` → absent components.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the picker and modal selection.**

```tsx
// ContactPicker.tsx
import { useEffect, useId, useState } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { contactsPage, type ContactOption } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
export function ContactPicker({ orgId, value, onChange, label, testId }: { orgId: string; value: string; onChange: (id: string) => void; label: string; testId?: string }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification'); const id = useId();
  const [items, setItems] = useState<ContactOption[]>([]); const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [more, setMore] = useState(false); const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState(false); const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true); const [retry, setRetry] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController(); setLoading(true); setError(false);
    void contactsPage(orgId, page, controller.signal).then(result => {
      if (controller.signal.aborted) return;
      setItems(old => [...new Map([...(page === 1 ? [] : old), ...result.data].map(c => [c.id, c])).values()]);
      setMore(result.pagination.page * result.pagination.limit < result.pagination.total);
    }).catch(() => { if (!controller.signal.aborted) setError(true); }).finally(() => { if (!controller.signal.aborted) setLoading(false); });
    return () => controller.abort();
  }, [orgId, page, retry]);
  const visible = items.filter(c => c.id === value || `${c.name ?? ''} ${c.email ?? ''}`.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));
  return <div><label htmlFor={`${id}-filter`}>{t('searchContacts')}</label><input id={`${id}-filter`} value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
    <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label><select id={id} data-testid={testId} value={value} onChange={e => onChange(e.target.value)}>
      <option value="">{t('selectContact')}</option>
      {value && !items.some(c => c.id === value) && <option value={value}>{value}</option>}
      {visible.map(c => <option key={c.id} value={c.id}>{c.name ?? c.email ?? c.id}</option>)}
    </select>{!loading && !visible.length && <p>{t('noContacts')}</p>}
    {loading && <p role="status">{t('loading')}</p>}{error && <p role="alert">{t('loadFailed')}</p>}
    {(more || error) && <button type="button" disabled={loading} onClick={() => error ? setRetry(n => n + 1) : setPage(p => p + 1)}>{t('more')}</button>}
  </div>;
}
```

Parent modal is keyed by org/context at every mount, so an org switch destroys picker state. Retries retain the failed page and retrigger its request.

The confirmation checkbox is implemented above and required together with selected-device readiness. Confirmation resets whenever contact/device/username changes or availability reloads. A pre-filled username is a suggestion, not confirmation. Task 5 owns cancellation and step-2 markup; `row`, `note`, and `setNote` are intentionally consumed there. The load-retry button retriggers all three reads after a transient failure.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.transport.test.tsx` → tier/availability and target-reset assertions pass.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactPicker.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.transport.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): select caller action target and verification method"
```

### Task 5: Polling, challenge script, terminal states, retry and cancel

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/useVerification.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/useVerification.test.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerificationStatus.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerificationStatus.test.tsx`. Modify `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.tsx` created in Task 4 (VerificationFlow state and step-2 slot).

**Interfaces:** Consumes `getVerification(orgId,id,signal): Promise<VerificationDetails>`. Produces `useVerification(orgId: string, initial: VerificationDetails | null): {row: VerificationDetails | null; error: boolean}` and `VerificationStatus({row, now?, userId?}): ReactNode`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing tests.**

```tsx
// useVerification.test.tsx
import { act, renderHook } from '@testing-library/react';
import { afterEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { getVerification } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';

  view.rerender(<VerificationStatus row={{ ...row, status: 'wrong_choice', remainingAttempts: 1 }} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Remaining attempts: 1')).toBeVisible();
  view.rerender(<VerificationStatus row={{ ...row, status: 'rejected_by_user', incidentId: row.id }} />);

});
it('distinguishes consumed failures from executing, completed and unknown outcomes', () => {

  const view = render(<VerificationStatus row={{ ...consumed, consumedIntentStatus: 'failed' }} />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-action-failed')).toHaveTextContent('Re-verify before trying the action again.');
  for (const consumedIntentStatus of ['executing', 'completed', null] as const) {

    expect(screen.queryByTestId('cv-action-failed')).toBeNull();
    expect(screen.getByText('Used for Reset password')).toBeVisible();
  }
});
```

Append to `VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx`, adding `act` to its Testing Library import. This exercises polling of a consumed row into a failed intent, followed by an explicit new challenge; the browser has no outbound identity-action client to replay.

```tsx
it('offers re-verification after consumed-intent failure without automatically starting anything', async () => {
  vi.mocked(api.getVerification).mockResolvedValue({ ...row, status: 'verified', consumedAt: row.createdAt, consumedAction: 'reset_password', consumedIntentStatus: 'failed', remainingAttempts: 1 });
  render(<VerifyCallerModal orgId={ORG} initialContactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')); fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-method-sms'));
  vi.useFakeTimers();
  try {
    await act(async () => { fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')); });
    await act(async () => { await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(2000); });
    expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-action-failed')).toBeVisible();
    expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(api.cancelVerification).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    await act(async () => { fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-reverify')); });
    expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')).toBeEnabled();
    vi.mocked(api.startVerification).mockResolvedValue({ ...row, id: TARGET });
    await act(async () => { fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')); });
    expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
    expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith({ orgId: ORG, contactId: CONTACT, method: 'sms', actionScope: 'reset_password' });
    expect(screen.queryByTestId('cv-action-failed')).toBeNull();
  } finally { vi.useRealTimers(); }
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/useVerification.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerificationStatus.test.tsx` → imports fail.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement polling and presentation.**

```tsx
// useVerification.ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { getVerification, type VerificationDetails } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
export function useVerification(orgId: string, initial: VerificationDetails | null) {
  const [row, setRow] = useState(initial); const [error, setError] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    setRow(initial); setError(false); if (!initial) return;
    const controller = new AbortController(); let timer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;
    async function poll() {
      try { const next = await getVerification(orgId, initial!.id, controller.signal); if (!controller.signal.aborted) { setRow(next); setError(false); } }
      catch { if (!controller.signal.aborted) setError(true); }
      finally { if (!controller.signal.aborted) timer = setTimeout(() => void poll(), 2000); }
    }
    timer = setTimeout(() => void poll(), 2000);
    return () => { controller.abort(); clearTimeout(timer); };
  }, [orgId, initial]);
  return { row, error };
}
```

Keep polling all visible statuses, not only pending: rejection is valid after expiry/verification. Await the previous GET before scheduling another. A failed GET removes any affirmative freshness claim by rendering the error instead of stale green status; it never fabricates `expired`. `initial` is stable state, not an inline object recreated on render.

```tsx
// VerificationStatus.tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import type { VerificationDetails } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
export function VerificationStatus({ row, now = Date.now(), userId }: { row: VerificationDetails; now?: number; userId?: string }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification');
  const action = t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `actions.${row.actionScope}`);
  const fresh = row.usableUntil !== null && Date.parse(row.usableUntil) > now;
  const owns = userId === row.initiatedByUserId;
  const showCodes = owns && row.status === 'pending' && row.secrets && row.method !== 'callback_attestation';
  return <section className={row.status === 'rejected_by_user' ? 'rounded border border-destructive bg-destructive/10 p-4' : 'space-y-3'}>
    <p role="status" aria-live="polite">{t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `states.${row.status}`)}</p>
    {showCodes && <><p>{t('match')}</p><strong data-testid="cv-match" className="block text-7xl tabular-nums">{row.secrets!.matchValue}</strong>
      <p>{t('reverse')}</p><strong data-testid="cv-reverse" className="block text-5xl tabular-nums">{row.secrets!.reverseCode.split('').join(' ')}</strong>
      {row.method !== 'workstation' && <p>{t('linkScript')}</p>}
      <p data-testid="cv-script">{t('script', { code: row.secrets!.reverseCode.split('').join(' '), number: row.secrets!.matchValue, action: t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `scriptActions.${row.actionScope}`), target: row.targetLabel ?? action })}</p><p>{t('knownNumber')}</p></>}
    {row.status === 'verified' && (row.consumedAt ? <p>{t('used', { action: row.consumedAction ? t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `actions.${row.consumedAction}`) : action })}</p> : fresh && owns ?
      <p>{t('usable', { action, minutes: Math.max(1, Math.ceil((Date.parse(row.usableUntil!) - now) / 60000)) })}</p> :
      <p>{fresh ? t('anotherTechnician', { technician: row.technicianLabel }) : t('states.expired')}</p>)}
    {row.consumedAt && row.consumedIntentStatus === 'failed' && <p role="alert" data-testid="cv-action-failed">{t('usedActionFailed')}</p>}
    {row.status === 'wrong_choice' && row.remainingAttempts !== null && <p>{t('remaining', { attempts: row.remainingAttempts })}</p>}
    {row.status === 'undeliverable' && <p>{t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `reasons.${row.undeliverableReason ?? 'unknown'}`)}</p>}
    {row.status === 'rejected_by_user' && row.incidentId && <a href={`/incidents/${encodeURIComponent(row.incidentId)}`}>{t('incident')}</a>}
  </section>;
}
```

In VerificationFlow, import `useAuthStore`, `useVerification`, `VerificationStatus`; add this code before the return, and insert the JSX at the step-2 slot. Changed rows refresh parent history/feed through a stable callback ref so a parent rerender does not restart polling. Call `onChanged` only when status/consumption/incident/freshness actually changes.

```tsx
const userId = useAuthStore(s => s.user?.id);
const polled = useVerification(props.orgId, row);
const current = polled.row;
const onChangedRef = useRef(props.onChanged);
onChangedRef.current = props.onChanged;
useEffect(() => { if (current) onChangedRef.current?.(current); }, [current?.id, current?.status, current?.consumedAt, current?.consumedIntentStatus, current?.incidentId, current?.usableUntil]);
async function cancel() {
  if (!current || busy.current) return;
  busy.current = true; setSaving(true);
  try { const cancelled = await api.cancelVerification(props.orgId, current.id); setRow(cancelled); }
  catch (e) { handleActionError(e, t('saveFailed')); }
  finally { busy.current = false; setSaving(false); }
}
async function attest() {
  if (!current || busy.current || note.trim().length < 20) return;
  busy.current = true; setSaving(true);
  try { setRow(await api.attestVerification(props.orgId, current.id, note.trim())); }
  catch (e) { handleActionError(e, t('saveFailed')); }
  finally { busy.current = false; setSaving(false); }
}
```

```tsx
{step === 2 && current && <>
  {polled.error ? <p role="alert">{t('loadFailed')}</p> : <VerificationStatus row={current} userId={userId} />}
  {current.status === 'pending' && current.method === 'callback_attestation' && <>
    <label>{t('note')}<textarea maxLength={4000} value={note} onChange={e => setNote(e.target.value)} /></label>
    <button disabled={saving || note.trim().length < 20} onClick={() => void attest()}>{t('attestCallback')}</button></>}
  {current.status === 'pending' && <button disabled={saving} onClick={() => void cancel()}>{t('cancel')}</button>}
  {current.status === 'verified' && current.consumedAt && current.consumedIntentStatus === 'failed' && <button data-testid="cv-reverify" disabled={saving || !current.remainingAttempts || polled.error} onClick={() => { setRow(null); setNote(''); setRetryLoad(n => n + 1); setStep(1); }}>{t('reverify')}</button>}
  {['wrong_choice', 'expired', 'undeliverable'].includes(current.status) && <button disabled={saving || !current.remainingAttempts || polled.error} onClick={() => { setRow(null); setStep(1); }}>{t('retry')}</button>}
</>}
```

A consumed-failure restart clears only the browser monitor and reloads availability/policy. It does not cancel, clear, or reuse the old grant, and never retries the protected action. The server retains consumption and enforces fences, attempt caps and freshness on the new start. Closing merely dismisses the monitor; the explicit cancel button mutates the pending challenge. Retry creates a new verification, never resubmits a number to a terminal row. Clear note and method on contact/action changes. Do not render candidate decoys to the technician.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/useVerification.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerificationStatus.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx` → pass, including this deferred-result regression:

```tsx
it('aborts a request that resolves after the monitor is unmounted', async () => {
  vi.useFakeTimers(); let resolve!: (value: typeof row) => void;
  vi.mocked(getVerification).mockReturnValue(new Promise(r => { resolve = r; }));
  const { unmount } = renderHook(() => useVerification(ORG, row));
  await act(async () => { await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(2000); });
  const signal = vi.mocked(getVerification).mock.calls[0][2]!;
  unmount(); expect(signal.aborted).toBe(true); resolve({ ...row, status: 'verified' });
  await act(async () => { await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(10000); });
  expect(getVerification).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

### Task 6: Shared hash launcher and accurate ticket badge

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.test.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx`.

**Interfaces:** Produces `CallerVerificationEntry(props: Omit<VerifyCallerModalProps,'onClose'> & {hash: string}): ReactNode`; `TicketVerificationBadge({orgId,ticketId,revision?}): ReactNode`. Consumes `freshForTicket`, never synthesizes badge state from contact history.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing tests.**

```tsx
// TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { freshForTicket } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
import { TicketVerificationBadge } from './TicketVerificationBadge';
import { ORG, row } from './testFixtures';
vi.mock('@/lib/api/callerVerification');
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
it('uses server freshness and consumed action, including any-scope grants', async () => {
  vi.mocked(freshForTicket).mockResolvedValue({ row: { ...row, status: 'verified', decidedAt: new Date(Date.now() - 720000).toISOString(), usableUntil: new Date(Date.now() + 900000).toISOString() }, isFresh: true, isConsumed: false });
  const view = render(<TicketVerificationBadge orgId={ORG} ticketId={row.id} />);
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('cv-badge')).toHaveTextContent('12 min ago');
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-badge')).toHaveTextContent('Unused');
  vi.mocked(freshForTicket).mockResolvedValue({ row: { ...row, actionScope: 'any', status: 'verified', consumedAction: 'reset_password', consumedAt: row.createdAt }, isFresh: false, isConsumed: true });
  view.rerender(<TicketVerificationBadge orgId={ORG} ticketId={row.id} revision={1} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-badge')).toHaveTextContent('Used for Reset password'));
  vi.mocked(freshForTicket).mockResolvedValue({ row, isFresh: false, isConsumed: false });
  view.rerender(<TicketVerificationBadge orgId={ORG} ticketId={row.id} revision={2} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-badge')).toHaveTextContent('Verification expired'));
});
```

Append to `TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx`:

```tsx
it('shows re-verification guidance for an any-scope grant whose consumed action failed', async () => {
  vi.mocked(freshForTicket).mockResolvedValue({ row: { ...row, status: 'verified', actionScope: 'any', consumedAt: row.createdAt, consumedAction: 'disable_user', consumedIntentStatus: 'failed' }, isFresh: false, isConsumed: true });
  render(<TicketVerificationBadge orgId={ORG} ticketId={row.id} />);
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('cv-badge')).toHaveTextContent('Verification used; action failed. Re-verify before trying the action again.');
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-badge')).not.toHaveTextContent('Unused');
});
```

```tsx
// CallerVerificationEntry.test.tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { CallerVerificationEntry } from './CallerVerificationEntry';
import { ORG } from './testFixtures';
const enabled = vi.hoisted(() => ({ value: false }));
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => enabled.value }));
vi.mock('./VerifyCallerModal', () => ({ VerifyCallerModal: () => <div data-testid="modal" /> }));
it('does not mount even when a verification hash is forged while disabled', () => {
  window.location.hash = 'overview/caller-verification';
  render(<CallerVerificationEntry orgId={ORG} hash="overview/caller-verification" />);
  expect(screen.queryByText('Verify caller')).toBeNull(); expect(screen.queryByTestId('modal')).toBeNull();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.test.tsx` → missing modules.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**

```tsx
// CallerVerificationEntry.tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { useHashState } from '@/lib/useHashState';
import { useCallerVerificationEnabled } from '@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled';
import { VerifyCallerModal, type VerifyCallerModalProps } from './VerifyCallerModal';
export function CallerVerificationEntry({ hash, ...props }: Omit<VerifyCallerModalProps, 'onClose'> & { hash: string }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification'); const enabled = useCallerVerificationEnabled();
  const [open, setOpen] = useHashState(false, raw => raw === hash);
  const previousHash = useRef<string | null>(null);
  if (!enabled) return null;
  const close = () => { setOpen(false); window.location.hash = previousHash.current ?? hash.split('/')[0]; };
  return <><button data-testid="cv-entry" onClick={() => { previousHash.current = window.location.hash; setOpen(true); window.location.hash = hash; }}>{t('title')}</button>
    {open && <VerifyCallerModal {...props} onClose={close} />}</>;
}
```

```tsx
// TicketVerificationBadge.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { freshForTicket, type TicketVerification } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';
import { useCallerVerificationEnabled } from '@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled';
type Props = { orgId: string; ticketId: string; revision?: number };
export function TicketVerificationBadge(props: Props) { return useCallerVerificationEnabled() ? <LoadedBadge key={`${props.orgId}:${props.ticketId}`} {...props} /> : null; }
function LoadedBadge({ orgId, ticketId, revision }: Props) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification'); const [data, setData] = useState<TicketVerification | null>(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController(); let timer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;
    const load = async () => {
      try { const result = await freshForTicket(orgId, ticketId, controller.signal); if (!controller.signal.aborted) setData(result); }
      catch { if (!controller.signal.aborted) setData(null); }
      finally { if (!controller.signal.aborted) timer = setTimeout(() => void load(), 2000); }
    };
    void load(); return () => { controller.abort(); clearTimeout(timer); };
  }, [orgId, ticketId, revision]);
  if (!data?.row) return null;
  const row = data.row; const fresh = row.status === 'verified' && data.isFresh && !!row.usableUntil && Date.parse(row.usableUntil) > Date.now();
  const age = t('age', { minutes: Math.max(0, Math.floor((Date.now() - Date.parse(row.decidedAt ?? row.createdAt)) / 60000)) });
  if (data.isConsumed && !row.consumedAction) return null;
  const used = data.isConsumed && row.consumedAction;
  const text = !['verified', 'pending', 'expired'].includes(row.status) ? t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `states.${row.status}`) : used && row.consumedIntentStatus === 'failed' ? t('usedActionFailed') : used ? t('used', { action: t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `actions.${row.consumedAction}`) }) : fresh ? t('unused') : t('states.expired');
  return <span data-testid="cv-badge" className={fresh && !used ? 'text-emerald-700' : 'text-muted-foreground'}>
    {fresh || used ? `${t('states.verified')} · ${t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `methods.${row.method}`)} · ${age} · ${text}` : text}
  </span>;
}
```

Rejected/revoked/cancelled rows show their actual state. W05 must supply `consumedAction` whenever `isConsumed` is true; until that projection is delivered, withhold an ambiguous consumed badge rather than inventing the operation. The guard before badge text enforces that rule.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.test.tsx` → pass.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): caller verification launcher and ticket grant badge"
```

### Task 7: Mount the ticket header workflow and prove timeline comments

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/components/tickets/ticketConfig.ts:58`, `TicketWorkbench.tsx:998–1016,1481–1487`, `apps/web/src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.test.tsx:1–50`, `apps/web/src/components/tickets/TicketFeed.test.tsx:42–89` in the same tickets directory.

**Interfaces:** Consumes the API's existing `requesterContactId` (full row selected at `apps/api/src/routes/tickets/tickets.ts:141–145`, spread at `:535`). Produces header `CallerVerificationEntry` + `TicketVerificationBadge`, keyed to ticket/org, and calls the existing `load` callback after verification changes. `submittedBy` remains a portal user ID, never a contact selector value.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing mount and timeline tests using verified existing helpers.**

```tsx
// TicketWorkbench.test.tsx: module-level child spies, then a new test.
vi.mock('../callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry', () => ({ CallerVerificationEntry: (p: Record<string, unknown>) => <div data-testid="cv-ticket-entry" data-props={JSON.stringify(p)} /> }));
vi.mock('../callerVerification/TicketVerificationBadge', () => ({ TicketVerificationBadge: (p: Record<string, unknown>) => <div data-testid="cv-ticket-badge" data-props={JSON.stringify(p)} /> }));
it('mounts verification with canonical requesterContactId rather than portal submittedBy', async () => {
  const orgId = '11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111';
  const contactId = '22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222';
  mockTicketApi({ 'tk-1': makeTicket({ orgId, requesterContactId: contactId, submittedBy: 'portal-user-7' }) });
  render(<TicketWorkbench ticketId="tk-1" />);
  await screen.findByTestId('ticket-workbench');
  expect(JSON.parse(screen.getByTestId('cv-ticket-entry').getAttribute('data-props')!)).toMatchObject({ orgId, ticketId: 'tk-1', initialContactId: contactId });
  expect(JSON.parse(screen.getByTestId('cv-ticket-badge').getAttribute('data-props')!)).toMatchObject({ orgId, ticketId: 'tk-1' });
});
// TicketFeed.test.tsx: makeComment and TicketFeed are existing imports/helper.
it('renders W01 caller-verification system comments', () => {
  const content = 'Caller verification started: SMS for password reset.';
  render(<TicketFeed comments={[makeComment({ commentType: 'system', authorType: 'system', authorName: null, userId: null, isPublic: false, content })]} />);
  expect(screen.getByText(content)).toBeVisible();
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('ticket-feed-system-collapsed')).toBeNull();
});
```

No new timeline renderer is required: `TicketFeed.tsx:10,32,51–74` already recognizes system comments and renders their content.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.test.tsx src/components/tickets/TicketFeed.test.tsx` → header mount missing; comment case documents existing behavior.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the mount.** Add `requesterContactId?: string | null;` to `TicketDetail`. Import both new components, add `const [verificationRevision, setVerificationRevision] = useState(0);`, and append this JSX to the header metadata row at line 998:

```tsx
<CallerVerificationEntry key={`${ticket.orgId}:${ticket.id}`} orgId={ticket.orgId}
  initialContactId={ticket.requesterContactId ?? undefined} ticketId={ticket.id}
  hash={`caller-verification/${ticket.id}`}
  onChanged={() => { setVerificationRevision(n => n + 1); void load(); }} />
<TicketVerificationBadge orgId={ticket.orgId} ticketId={ticket.id} revision={verificationRevision} />
```

The existing TicketFeed receives refreshed `ticket.comments` after `load`. Missing requesterContactId opens the explicit picker. A ticket whose contact is changed is still validated by the start endpoint; the browser cannot transfer a grant between requesters. The shared launcher restores its captured previous hash on close, preserving an embedded queue selection.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.test.tsx src/components/tickets/TicketFeed.test.tsx` → canonical contact ID and system comment visible.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/tickets/ticketConfig.ts apps/web/src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.tsx apps/web/src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/tickets/TicketFeed.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): verify callers from the ticket header and timeline"
```

### Task 8: Contact drawer history, fence, bindings and destinations

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.test.tsx`. Existing drawer primitive: `apps/web/src/components/shared/Drawer.tsx:31–50` accepts `open`, `onClose`, `title`, `closeDisabled`.

**Interfaces:** Consumes `contactHistory`, `directoryUsers`, `bindContact`, `unbindContact`, `attestDestination`, `fenceOverride`; produces `ContactVerificationDrawer({orgId,contactId,onClose}): ReactNode`. Binding picker accepts only a returned `DirectoryUser`, never free-form identity fields.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing tests.**

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import * as api from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';

beforeEach(() => { vi.clearAllMocks(); vi.mocked(api.contactHistory).mockResolvedValue(history); vi.mocked(api.getPolicy).mockResolvedValue({ row: null, defaults: policy, baseline: policy, effective: policy }); });
it('shows the fence and sends its override reason, then reloads', async () => {
  vi.mocked(api.contactHistory).mockResolvedValue({ ...history, fencedUntil: '2099-01-01T00:00:00Z' });
  render(<ContactVerificationDrawer orgId={ORG} contactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  await screen.findByText(/Blocked until/);
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-fence-reason'), { target: { value: 'Independent investigation completed' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Override the block'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.fenceOverride).toHaveBeenCalledWith(ORG, CONTACT, 'Independent investigation completed'));
});
it('attests the destination id and never labels it established optimistically', async () => {
  vi.mocked(api.contactHistory).mockResolvedValue({ ...history, destinations: [{ id: row.id, kind: 'mobile', valueRedacted: '+1 ••12', established: false, attestedAt: null, setAt: row.createdAt, source: 'import' }] });
  render(<ContactVerificationDrawer orgId={ORG} contactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  fireEvent.click(await screen.findByText('Confirm number of record'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.attestDestination).toHaveBeenCalledWith(ORG, CONTACT, row.id));
  expect(screen.getByText('Destination is not yet established.')).toBeVisible();

```

Extend the same harness with unavailable/error transitions. W01 owns Graph authorization and tenant rechecks; these tests prove W04 removes stale selectable results and does not invent a binding.

```tsx
it.each(['unavailable', 'error'] as const)('clears prior directory choices when the next search is %s', async outcome => {
  const user = { entraTenantId: ORG, entraOid: CONTACT, upn: 'ada@example.test', displayName: 'Ada' };
  vi.mocked(api.directoryUsers).mockResolvedValueOnce({ available: true, users: [user], truncated: false });
  if (outcome === 'unavailable') vi.mocked(api.directoryUsers).mockResolvedValueOnce({ available: false, users: [], truncated: false });
  else vi.mocked(api.directoryUsers).mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Graph unavailable'));
  render(<ContactVerificationDrawer orgId={ORG} contactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  fireEvent.change(await screen.findByLabelText('Search Entra users'), { target: { value: 'Ada' } });
  await screen.findByText('Ada · ada@example.test');
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Bind to Entra user'), { target: { value: `${ORG}:${CONTACT}` } });
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Search Entra users'), { target: { value: 'Grace' } });
  expect(screen.queryByRole('button', { name: 'Bind to Entra user' })).toBeNull();
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.directoryUsers).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2));
  if (outcome === 'error') expect(await screen.findByRole('alert')).toHaveTextContent('Could not load verification details. Try again.');
  else await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-directory-unavailable')).toBeVisible());
  expect(screen.queryByText('Ada · ada@example.test')).toBeNull();
  expect(api.bindContact).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

The server may still refuse unbind/attest/override for stale MFA or site scope; `runAction` surfaces those outcomes. Do not promote `established` locally after an attestation: age still applies. W05's incident link may be briefly null while fan-out completes; a reload reveals it. The sequential 2 s history/policy refresh hides stale controls and affirmative status after a failed read; cleanup aborts it on close.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.test.tsx` → fence and destination tests pass. Include this executable binding regression in the same harness:

```tsx
it('binds only the selected Graph result and unbinds by binding id', async () => {
  const user = { entraTenantId: ORG, entraOid: CONTACT, upn: 'ada@example.test', displayName: 'Ada' };
  vi.mocked(api.directoryUsers).mockResolvedValue({ available: true, users: [user], truncated: false });
  vi.mocked(api.contactHistory).mockResolvedValue({ ...history, bindings: [{ id: row.id, entraTenantId: ORG, entraOid: CONTACT, upnSnapshot: user.upn, osPrincipal: null, revokedAt: null }] });
  render(<ContactVerificationDrawer orgId={ORG} contactId={CONTACT} onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  fireEvent.change(await screen.findByLabelText('Search Entra users'), { target: { value: 'Ada' } });
  await screen.findByText('Ada · ada@example.test');
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Bind to Entra user'), { target: { value: `${ORG}:${CONTACT}` } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Bind to Entra user' }));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.bindContact).toHaveBeenCalledWith(ORG, CONTACT, user));
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText('Remove binding')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Remove binding'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.unbindContact).toHaveBeenCalledWith(ORG, CONTACT, row.id));
});
```

```

### Task 9: Mount contact rows, the drawer and bulk destination attestation

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.tsx:141,614,663`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx`; `apps/web/src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.ts:82–84`, `apps/web/src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.test.ts`. `apps/web/src/components/organizations/record/OrganizationRecordPage.tsx:300` already mounts ContactsCard and needs no edit. Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.tsx` and `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.test.tsx` in Steps 6–10.

**Interfaces:** Produces hash `#contacts/<contactId>/verification` and nested `/start`; consumes `ContactVerificationDrawer` and `CallerVerificationEntry`. Existing inline editor at `ContactsCard.tsx:444` remains the edit surface; the new drawer is the verification management surface the spec assumes but the repo does not yet have.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing parser and mount tests.**

```ts
// Append to orgRecordTabs.test.ts; tabFromHash is already exported.
it('keeps the contacts island mounted for verification drawer hashes', () => {
  expect(tabFromHash('#contacts/22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222/verification')).toBe('contacts');
  expect(tabFromHash('#contacts/22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222/verification/start')).toBe('contacts');
});
```

In ContactsCard.test.tsx use its existing `mockApi`, `renderCard`, `ORG_ID`, `CONTACTS` fixtures and these module-scope mocks:

```tsx
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
vi.mock('@/lib/permissions', () => ({ usePermissions: () => ({ can: () => true }) }));
vi.mock('../callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry', () => ({ CallerVerificationEntry: () => null }));
vi.mock('../callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer', () => ({ ContactVerificationDrawer: (p: {contactId: string}) => <div data-testid="cv-contact-drawer-stub" data-contact={p.contactId} /> }));
```

Then add:

```tsx
it('opens verification management for the selected row', async () => {
  mockApi(); await renderCard();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId(`cv-contact-history-${CONTACTS[0].id}`));
  await waitFor(() => expect(window.location.hash).toBe(`#contacts/${CONTACTS[0].id}/verification`));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-contact-drawer-stub')).toHaveAttribute('data-contact', CONTACTS[0].id);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.test.ts` → nested tab rejected and action absent.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement explicit mounts.** Change `tabFromHash`'s raw line to `const raw = hash.replace(/^#/, '').split('/')[0];`. Add imports for readiness, permissions, `useHashState`, both components; inside ContactsCard add:

```tsx
const cvEnabled = useCallerVerificationEnabled();
const { can } = usePermissions();
const [verificationContact, setVerificationContact] = useHashState<string | null>(null, raw => {
  const parts = raw.split('/');
  return parts[0] === 'contacts' && parts[2] === 'verification' ? parts[1] || null : null;
});
```

Inside the row's existing action cell (the map variable is `c`), add:

```tsx
{cvEnabled && <>
  {can('organizations', 'write') && <CallerVerificationEntry orgId={orgId} initialContactId={c.id} hash={`contacts/${c.id}/verify-caller`} />}
  <button data-testid={`cv-contact-history-${c.id}`} onClick={() => { setVerificationContact(c.id); window.location.hash = `contacts/${c.id}/verification`; }}>{i18n.t('callerVerification:history')}</button>
</>}
```

After the table, mount exactly one drawer:

```tsx
{cvEnabled && verificationContact && <ContactVerificationDrawer key={`${orgId}:${verificationContact}`} orgId={orgId} contactId={verificationContact} onClose={() => { setVerificationContact(null); window.location.hash = 'contacts'; }} />}
```

The row uses `/verify-caller`; the drawer parser accepts only `/verification`, and its nested start uses `/verification/start`, so only one start modal mounts. Both paths retain the contacts tab. The row action and the drawer button are explicit entry points. Import `i18n` from `@/lib/i18n` if not present.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.test.ts` → selection survives hash navigation without changing query parameters.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.ts apps/web/src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): mount caller verification on contact rows and drawer"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Write failing bulk-attestation tests.** Read existing `ContactsCard.test.tsx`, `BulkContactImport.test.tsx` and `runAction.test.ts` before implementing. The standalone bulk component tests keep the real API client and `runAction` so every per-destination POST is authenticated, org-pinned and produces feedback. No bulk backend endpoint or permission bypass is introduced.

```tsx
// BulkDestinationAttestation.test.tsx

const destination = { id: row.id, kind: 'email' as const, valueRedacted: 'a••@example.test', established: false, attestedAt: null, setAt: row.createdAt, source: 'import' as const };
const posts = () => mocks.fetch.mock.calls.filter(([, init]) => init?.method === 'POST');
afterEach(cleanup);
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks(); mocks.enabled = true; mocks.write = true;
  mocks.fetch.mockImplementation(async (path: string, init: RequestInit = {}) => {
    expect(new URL(path, 'https://breeze.example.test').searchParams.get('orgId')).toBe(ORG);
    const grace = path.includes(`/contacts/${TARGET}/`);
    if (init.method === 'POST') return new Response(JSON.stringify(grace ? { error: 'Forbidden' } : { data: { id: row.id, attestedAt: row.createdAt } }), { status: grace ? 403 : 200 });
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: { ...history, destinations: [{ ...destination, id: grace ? TARGET : row.id }] } }));
  });
});
it('reports partial failure, preserves establishment and retries only the failed destination', async () => {
  render(<BulkDestinationAttestation orgId={ORG} contacts={contacts} />);
  expect(mocks.fetch).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-bulk-review'));
  fireEvent.click(await screen.findByTestId(`cv-bulk-destination-${row.id}`));
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId(`cv-bulk-destination-${TARGET}`));
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-bulk-confirm'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-bulk-result')).toHaveTextContent('Attested: 1. Failed: 1.'));

  expect(screen.getAllByText('Destination is not yet established.')).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(mocks.toast).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'success' }));
  expect(mocks.toast).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'error' }));
  mocks.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce(new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: { id: TARGET, attestedAt: row.createdAt } })));

});
it('does not attest destinations when their history could not be loaded', async () => {

  expect(posts()).toHaveLength(0);
});
it.each(['disabled', 'read-only'] as const)('makes no request and renders no controls when %s', mode => {

  render(<BulkDestinationAttestation orgId={ORG} contacts={contacts} />);
  expect(screen.queryByRole('button')).toBeNull(); expect(mocks.fetch).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it('prevents duplicate submission and stops the remaining batch after unmount', async () => {

  await waitFor(() => expect(mocks.toast).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'success' })));
  expect(posts()).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

Add this stub alongside the Task-9 drawer stub in `ContactsCard.test.tsx`, and add a mount test using its real list fixture. These UI fixture IDs are pre-existing contact-list test data; endpoint tests above use valid UUIDs.

```tsx
vi.mock('../callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation', () => ({ BulkDestinationAttestation: (p: { contacts: { id: string }[] }) => <div data-testid="cv-bulk-stub">{p.contacts.map(c => c.id).join(',')}</div> }));
it('passes only checked contact rows to bulk attestation', async () => {
  mockApi(); await renderCard();
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('cv-bulk-stub')).toBeNull();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId(`cv-select-contact-${CONTACTS[0].id}`));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-bulk-stub')).toHaveTextContent(CONTACTS[0].id);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-bulk-stub')).not.toHaveTextContent(CONTACTS[1].id);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId(`cv-select-contact-${CONTACTS[0].id}`));
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('cv-bulk-stub')).toBeNull();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.test.tsx src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx` → component and selection controls absent.
- [ ] **Step 8: Implement contact-list selection and the review/attest component.** Add the import for `BulkDestinationAttestation` to ContactsCard. Its existing state includes `contacts`, `page`, `siteFilter`, `roleFilter`, `loading`, `loadError`; use them directly:

```tsx
const [attestationContacts, setAttestationContacts] = useState<string[]>([]);
useEffect(() => { setAttestationContacts([]); }, [orgId, page, siteFilter, roleFilter]);
const bulkContacts = contacts.filter(c => attestationContacts.includes(c.id))
  .map(c => ({ id: c.id, name: c.name ?? c.email ?? c.id }));
```

Inside the existing first `<td>` for each `c`, before the name, add:

```tsx
{cvEnabled && can('organizations', 'write') && <input type="checkbox"
  data-testid={`cv-select-contact-${c.id}`}
  aria-label={i18n.t('callerVerification:bulkSelect', { name: c.name ?? c.email ?? c.id })}
  checked={attestationContacts.includes(c.id)} disabled={loading}
  onChange={e => setAttestationContacts(ids => e.target.checked ? [...new Set([...ids, c.id])] : ids.filter(id => id !== c.id))} />}
```

Above the existing table mount:

```tsx
{cvEnabled && can('organizations', 'write') && !loading && !loadError && bulkContacts.length > 0 &&
  <BulkDestinationAttestation key={`${orgId}:${bulkContacts.map(c => c.id).sort().join(':')}`} orgId={orgId} contacts={bulkContacts} />}
```

Selection is limited to the visible page, clears on org/filter/page changes, and never goes into a URL. Changing selection remounts the review so stale destination IDs cannot carry into a different batch. Each authorized history response supplies the current destination IDs; contact email/mobile text is never used to synthesize one.

          handleActionError(error, t('saveFailed')); outcome = 'failed';

        if (signal.aborted) return;

```

The review lists redacted destinations and requires a separate checkbox for each attestation. Per-item `attestDestination` uses Task 1's `runAction` client, preserving W01's ORGS_WRITE/MFA/site authorization. A 403/409/5xx failure is visible and stays selected for an explicit retry; success is deselected and cannot be replayed. A 401 stops the batch for auth handling. Unmount stops subsequent POSTs but cannot undo one already sent. Attestation does not optimistically set `established`: the displayed value remains the history result until a fresh review. Existing `ContactsCard.tsx` is already in `TARGET_GLOBS`; Task 15 adds the new mutation owner with no exemptions.

- [ ] **Step 9: Run green.**

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.test.tsx src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts src/lib/i18n/callerVerification.test.ts)
```

Expected: only selected destination IDs are posted, failures remain retryable, successes are not replayed, unavailable history produces no mutation, and dark/read-only surfaces make no requests.

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit the bulk contact-list workflow.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): attest selected contact destinations with partial-failure feedback"
```

### Task 10: Mount device-header verification with explicit username confirmation

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.tsx:344,666–668`, `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx:9–29`. Modify `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx` (device preselection cases).

**Interfaces:** Consumes `device.id`, `device.orgId`, `deviceSuggestions(...): Promise<DeviceSuggestion[]>`; produces header entry with `initialMethod='workstation'`. `hasBinding` from the selected suggestion is the only basis for displaying tier 3, and cannot raise the method endpoint's tier.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing device cases to the modal harness.**

```tsx
it('caps an unbound selected workstation at tier 1 and requires confirmation', async () => {
  vi.mocked(api.deviceSuggestions).mockResolvedValue([{ deviceId: TARGET, hostname: 'Workstation A', username: 'ada', hasBinding: false, available: true }]);
  vi.mocked(api.methodsForContact).mockResolvedValue([{ method: 'workstation', available: true, tier: 3, reason: 'bound_principal' }]);
  render(<VerifyCallerModal orgId={ORG} initialContactId={CONTACT} deviceId={TARGET} initialMethod="workstation" onClose={vi.fn()} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-next')).toBeEnabled());
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-next'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-method-workstation')).toHaveTextContent('Assurance tier 1');
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-start')).toBeDisabled();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username'));
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-start'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(api.startVerification).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ deviceId: TARGET, username: 'ada', method: 'workstation' })));
});
```

Parameterize the preceding test with `[false, true]` through `it.each([false, true])`, pass `hasBinding` into the suggestion, and expect `Assurance tier ${hasBinding ? 3 : 1}`. After confirming, edit `cv-username` to `different-user`, assert `cv-confirm-username` is unchecked and the card is tier 1, then restore `ada` and reconfirm before the start click. The exact edit/assertion code is:

```tsx
fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-username'), { target: { value: 'different-user' } });
expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username')).not.toBeChecked();
expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-method-workstation')).toHaveTextContent('Assurance tier 1');
fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-username'), { target: { value: 'ada' } });
fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-confirm-username'));
```

Existing `DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx` keeps `installAstroClientRouterStandIn` and its automatic fetch/router setup. Add this module-scope stub and independent mount test:

```tsx
vi.mock('../callerVerification/CallerVerificationEntry', () => ({ CallerVerificationEntry: (props: Record<string, unknown>) => <div data-testid="cv-device-entry" data-props={JSON.stringify(props)} /> }));
it('mounts workstation verification for the displayed device', async () => {
  render(<DeviceDetails device={device} />);
  expect(JSON.parse((await screen.findByTestId('cv-device-entry')).getAttribute('data-props')!)).toMatchObject({ orgId: device.orgId, deviceId: device.id, initialMethod: 'workstation' });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx` → mount absent / confirmation absent.
- [ ] **Step 3: Add the explicit header mount, beside DeviceActions.**

```tsx
<CallerVerificationEntry key={device.id} orgId={device.orgId} deviceId={device.id}
  initialMethod="workstation" hash={`${activeTab}/caller-verification`} />
<DeviceActions device={device} onAction={onAction} />
```

The current `activeTab: Tab` declaration is at DeviceDetails.tsx:400, derived from hashTab initialized at :344. The current parser already takes the first slash segment (`:233–237`). Restore the previous hash on dismissal through the Task-7 launcher update. Do not use `last_user` as consent: the username input must be confirmed after contact selection.

Task 4 already implements username confirmation and selected-device readiness. Preserve its entire workstation `canStart` predicate, including `selectedDevice?.available === true`; device-header preselection must not bypass it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx` → both binding cases and hash navigation pass.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.tsx apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): verify callers from a confirmed workstation session"
```

### Task 11: Partner baseline and organization tighten-only policy form

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.test.tsx`. Precedent: `apps/web/src/components/software/PolicyForm.tsx:18–22,87–116` for owner scope and “All organizations”; do not add ownerScope to PUT payloads.

**Interfaces:** Consumes `getPolicy(owner,signal): Promise<PolicyResponse>`, `putPolicy(owner,draft): Promise<PolicyResponse>`; produces `CallerVerificationPolicyForm({owner,readOnly?}): ReactNode`. Policy GET must supply `baseline` separately from `effective` to constrain org overrides correctly.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing policy tests.**

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { getPolicy, putPolicy } from '@/lib/api/callerVerification';

import { ORG, policy } from './testFixtures';
vi.mock('@/lib/api/callerVerification');
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
it('shows provenance, ignored fields and disables loosening values', async () => {
  vi.mocked(getPolicy).mockResolvedValue({ row: null, defaults: policy, baseline: policy, effective: { ...policy, provenance: { requiredTierResetPassword: 'partner' }, ignored: ['requiredTierResetPassword'] } });
  render(<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={{ ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: ORG }} />);
  expect(await screen.findByText('From partner policy')).toBeVisible();
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-policy-requiredTierResetPassword')).toHaveAttribute('min', '2');
  expect(screen.getByText(/Ignored because it weakens/)).toBeVisible();
});
it('keeps the tier-0 warning visible after a successful save', async () => {
  const result = { row: { ...inheritedDraft(), requiredTierResetPassword: 0 }, defaults: policy, baseline: { ...policy, requiredTierResetPassword: 0 }, effective: { ...policy, requiredTierResetPassword: 0 } };
  vi.mocked(getPolicy).mockResolvedValue(result); vi.mocked(putPolicy).mockResolvedValue(result);
  render(<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={{ ownerScope: 'partner' }} />);
  await screen.findByText(/A tier of 0 disables/);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Save policy'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(putPolicy).toHaveBeenCalled());
  expect(screen.getByText(/A tier of 0 disables/)).toBeVisible();
});
it.each([
  { scope: 'partner' as const, override: null, baseline: 30, expected: 30, max: 240 },
  { scope: 'organization' as const, override: null, baseline: 20, expected: 20, max: 20 },
  { scope: 'organization' as const, override: 10, baseline: 20, expected: 10, max: 20 },
])('uses the inherited floor separately from the $scope effective value $expected', async example => {
  const response = { row: example.override === null ? null : { ...inheritedDraft(), verificationTtlMinutes: example.override },
    defaults: { ...policy, verificationTtlMinutes: 30 }, baseline: { ...policy, verificationTtlMinutes: example.baseline },
    effective: { ...policy, verificationTtlMinutes: example.expected } };
  vi.mocked(getPolicy).mockResolvedValue(response);
  const owner = example.scope === 'partner' ? { ownerScope: example.scope } : { ownerScope: example.scope, orgId: ORG };
  render(<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={owner} />);
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('cv-policy-verificationTtlMinutes')).toHaveValue(example.expected);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-policy-verificationTtlMinutes-effective')).toHaveTextContent(String(example.expected));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-policy-verificationTtlMinutes')).toHaveAttribute('max', String(example.max));
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.test.tsx` → absent form.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement field-by-field constraints, null inheritance and effective preview.**

```

The numeric ranges match W01 Task 8's `callerVerificationPolicySchema` (attempt cap 1–100, cooling-off 1–720 hours). Null partner fields render built-in defaults; null org fields render the partner baseline. Keep actual `effective` values and provenance separate from unsaved draft values. Format boolean/array effective outputs with the same translated options used by the editor, using this local formatter before the JSX:

```tsx
const displayValue = (key: keyof PolicyValues): string => {
  const current = data.effective[key];
  if (typeof current === 'boolean') return current ? t('common:labels.yes') : t('common:labels.no');
  if (typeof current === 'number') return new Intl.NumberFormat().format(current);
  return current.map(option => key === 'allowedMethods' ? t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `methods.${option}`) : settings(/* i18n-dynamic */ `contactsCard.roles.${option === 'after_hours' ? 'afterHours' : option}`)).join(', ');
};
```
Replace the output's `String(data.effective[key])` with `displayValue(key)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.test.tsx` → provenance, ignored and warning assertions pass. Include this read-only regression:

```tsx
it('disables all policy mutation controls for read-only operators', async () => {
  vi.mocked(getPolicy).mockResolvedValue({ row: null, defaults: policy, baseline: policy, effective: policy });
  render(<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={{ ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: ORG }} readOnly />);
  expect(await screen.findByText('Save policy')).toBeDisabled();
  expect(screen.getByTestId('cv-policy-requiredTierResetPassword')).toBeDisabled();
});
```
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): edit caller policy with partner provenance and tightening bounds"
```

### Task 12: Mount policy forms in partner and organization settings

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx:637–640`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx`; `apps/web/src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.tsx:606–615`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx` in that directory.

**Interfaces:** Consumes `CallerVerificationPolicyForm({owner,readOnly})`. Produces partner form in existing `#security`, and org form next to `OrgSecuritySettings`. `ownerScope` is fixed by the shell, not switchable on an update. The partner ID is derived server-side.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing shell tests.** Add a module-scope policy-form stub in each test file, then use its existing local fixtures:

```tsx
vi.mock('../callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm', () => ({ CallerVerificationPolicyForm: (props: Record<string, unknown>) => <div data-testid="cv-policy-mount" data-props={JSON.stringify(props)} /> }));
// OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx, inside its general-tab describe where orgDetails exists:
it('mounts org caller policy beside security settings', async () => {
  window.location.hash = '#security';
  fetchWithAuthMock.mockImplementation(async (url: string) => url.endsWith('/effective-settings') ? makeJsonResponse({ locked: [] }) : makeJsonResponse(orgDetails));
  render(<OrgSettingsPage orgId="org-1" />);
  const mount = await screen.findByTestId('cv-policy-mount');
  expect(JSON.parse(mount.getAttribute('data-props')!).owner).toEqual({ ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: 'org-1' });
});
// PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx: separate test, using module-level store/response helpers.
it('mounts partner-wide caller policy in security', async () => {
  window.location.hash = '#security';
  useOrgStoreMock.mockReturnValue({ currentPartnerId: 'partner-1', isLoading: false } as never);
  fetchWithAuthMock.mockImplementation(async (url) => String(url) === '/orgs/partners/me'
    ? makeJsonResponse({ id: 'partner-1', name: 'Acme MSP', slug: 'acme', type: 'partner', plan: 'pro', settings: {}, createdAt: '2026-02-09T00:00:00Z' }) : makeJsonResponse({ data: [] }));
  render(<PartnerSettingsPage />);
  const mount = await screen.findByTestId('cv-policy-mount');
  expect(JSON.parse(mount.getAttribute('data-props')!).owner).toEqual({ ownerScope: 'partner' });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx` → no policy mount.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement both explicit mounts.** Import the form and `usePermissions`/`useAuthStore` as needed. In each page compute `const { can } = usePermissions();`; in partner settings compute `const canManageCallerPolicy = useAuthStore(s => s.user?.canManagePartnerWide === true);`. Add alongside existing security JSX:

```tsx
// PartnerSettingsPage.tsx, inside activeTab === 'security' section:
<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={{ ownerScope: 'partner' }} readOnly={!canManageCallerPolicy || !can('organizations', 'write')} />
// OrgSettingsPage.tsx, wrap the existing case's OrgSecuritySettings in a fragment:
<CallerVerificationPolicyForm owner={{ ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: effectiveOrgId }} readOnly={!can('organizations', 'write')} />
```

The form gates its own data-fetching child with readiness. Use parent read gates if org-read permission is absent. Add the following member to each existing test auth factory (retain its existing fetch export), and stub `usePermissions` so permission reading does not alter unrelated shell tests:

```tsx
useAuthStore: (selector: (state: { user: { canManagePartnerWide: boolean } }) => unknown) => selector({ user: { canManagePartnerWide: true } }),
```
```tsx
vi.mock('@/lib/permissions', () => ({ usePermissions: () => ({ can: () => true }) }));
``` Do not add new settings navigation labels, pages or query-state parameters.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.test.tsx` → pass including read-only rendering.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): mount caller policy in partner and org security settings"
```

### Task 13: Interactive administrative disable with resource-bound MFA

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/lib/mfaStepUp.ts:64`, `apps/web/src/lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts`; `apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts` (POST adapter). Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.test.tsx`; modify `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.tsx` (management section after destinations).

**Interfaces:** Keep `mintStepUpGrant`'s current return `Promise<string>` and existing arguments; add optional `post?: (path: string, body: unknown, fallback: string) => Promise<Record<string, any>>`. Consumes W05 operation `caller_verification_administrative_disable`, resource `{orgId,entraTenantId,entraOid,reason}` and `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/administrative {targetContactId,reason,stepUpGrantId}`. Browser sends resource fields; server computes `sha256(orgId | entraTenantId | entraOid | sha256(reason))`. A client-supplied digest alone is not accepted.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing ceremony and flow tests.**

```ts
// mfaStepUp.test.ts, in the existing describe (startAuthenticationMock exists).
it('uses an injected POST transport for both passkey requests', async () => {
  const post = vi.fn().mockResolvedValueOnce({ options: { challenge: 'c' } }).mockResolvedValueOnce({ stepUpGrantId: 'grant' });
  startAuthenticationMock.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'credential' });
  await expect(mintStepUpGrant({ operation: 'caller_verification_administrative_disable', resource: { orgId: 'o', entraTenantId: 't', entraOid: 'u', reason: 'Offboarding approved by HR' }, reauth: { method: 'passkey' }, post })).resolves.toBe('grant');
  expect(post.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])).toEqual(['/auth/mfa/step-up/options', '/auth/mfa/step-up']);
  expect(fetchWithAuthMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

```tsx

});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.test.tsx` → transport ignored / component absent.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the transport seam without duplicating WebAuthn.** Add `post` to the options type and `const post = opts.post ?? postOrThrow;` at the top of `mintStepUpGrant`; replace its two calls to `postOrThrow` with `post`. Leave the original helper and its callers' error behavior unchanged. Export this adapter from callerVerification.ts:

```ts
export function stepUpPost(path: string, body: unknown, _fallback: string): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
  return runAction<Record<string, any>>({
    request: () => fetchWithAuth(path, { method: 'POST', orgIdOverride: null, ...(body === undefined ? {} : { body: JSON.stringify(body) }) }),
    errorFallback: i18n.t('callerVerification:saveFailed'),
    parseSuccess: data => { if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') throw new Error('Invalid step-up response'); return data as Record<string, any>; },
  });
}
```

No success toast is required for an intermediate passkey-options request; its next visible factor prompt is feedback. The administrative creation itself has `runAction` success feedback. Existing proof rejection is 400 `mfa_proof_invalid`; retain normal 401 session refresh semantics (`mfaStepUp.ts:41`), rather than treating a login failure as a wrong factor.

```tsx
// AdministrativeDisable.tsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import StepUpPrompt from '@/components/settings/StepUpPrompt';
import { fetchWithAuth } from '@/stores/auth';
import { mintStepUpGrant } from '@/lib/mfaStepUp';

export function AdministrativeDisable(props: Props) { return useCallerVerificationEnabled() ? <AdminFlow key={`${props.orgId}:${props.targetContactId}:${props.binding.id}`} {...props} /> : null; }
function AdminFlow({ orgId, targetContactId, binding, onCreated, onBusyChange }: Props) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification'); const [reason, setReason] = useState(''); const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const [factor, setFactor] = useState<'passkey' | 'totp' | null>(null); const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false); const [error, setError] = useState(false);

      if (!c.signal.aborted) { setFactor(keys.passkeys?.length ? 'passkey' : user.mfaMethod === 'totp' ? 'totp' : null); setLoaded(true); }
    }).catch(() => { if (!c.signal.aborted) { setError(true); setLoaded(true); } });
    return () => c.abort();
  }, [step]);

      const result = await createAdministrative(orgId, targetContactId, snapshot.reason, grant); onCreated(result); setStep(0); setReason('');
    } catch (e) { handleActionError(e, t('saveFailed')); }
    finally { busy.current = false; setSaving(false); setCode(''); onBusyChange?.(false); }
  }
  return <section><h3>{t('adminTitle')}</h3><p>{binding.upnSnapshot ?? binding.entraOid}</p>
    <label>{t('reason')}<textarea maxLength={4000} data-testid="cv-admin-reason" disabled={saving || step === 1} value={reason} onChange={e => setReason(e.target.value)} /></label>
    {step === 0 ? <button data-testid="cv-admin-next" disabled={reason.trim().length < 20} onClick={() => setStep(1)}>{t('next')}</button> : <>

      <button disabled={saving} onClick={() => { setStep(0); setCode(''); }}>{t('back')}</button>
      <button data-testid="cv-admin-submit" disabled={saving || !factor || (factor === 'totp' && !/^\d{6}$/.test(code))} onClick={() => void submit()}>{t('adminSubmit')}</button>
    </>}
  </section>;
}
```

Mount in LoadedDrawer only when write is allowed, the freshly loaded effective policy permits administrative disable, and exactly one active Entra binding exists for the target contact. Fetch `getPolicy` alongside history. Import AdministrativeDisable and render:

```tsx
const activeBindings = error ? [] : data?.bindings.filter(b => !b.revokedAt && b.entraTenantId && b.entraOid) ?? [];
{write && effectivePolicy?.allowAdministrativeDisable && activeBindings.length === 1 &&
  <AdministrativeDisable orgId={orgId} targetContactId={contactId} binding={activeBindings[0]} onBusyChange={setAdminBusy} onCreated={() => setRevision(n => n + 1)} />}
```

Do not silently choose among multiple bindings. The `onBusyChange` callback locks the drawer while the mint/create sequence is in flight. Never save/reuse a minted grant after failure. Every retry proves a fresh factor. This creates a single-use grant only; the account action still passes through the existing approval/release workflow.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.test.tsx src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.test.tsx` → exact resource, reason and grant handoff. Parameterize the flow test with rejected mint and passkey cancellation; the following failure case is required:

```tsx
it('never creates an administrative row after factor rejection', async () => {
  vi.mocked(api.createAdministrative).mockClear(); vi.mocked(mintStepUpGrant).mockRejectedValue(new Error('factor rejected'));
  render(<AdministrativeDisable orgId={ORG} targetContactId={CONTACT} binding={{ id: row.id, entraTenantId: ORG, entraOid: CONTACT, upnSnapshot: 'ada@example.test', osPrincipal: null, revokedAt: null }} onCreated={vi.fn()} />);
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('cv-admin-reason'), { target: { value: 'Offboarding approved by HR' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-admin-next'));
  fireEvent.change(await screen.findByTestId('approver-stepup-code'), { target: { value: '123456' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cv-admin-submit'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('approver-stepup-code')).toHaveValue(''));
  expect(api.createAdministrative).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/lib/mfaStepUp.ts apps/web/src/lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts apps/web/src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): create administrative disable grants through MFA step-up"
```

### Task 14: Inline AI refusal workflow with pinned organization and action

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.test.tsx`. Modify `apps/web/src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.tsx:298–307`, `apps/web/src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.test.tsx`. No change to `AiToolCallCard.tsx:65` approval-handoff trust rules.

**Interfaces:** Consumes a tool error containing exact inner `requiresCallerVerification: {contactId: string | null, requiredTier: number, reason: string}`. W05 must preserve the full index `CallerVerificationRequiredError.payload` inside `requiresCallerVerification`, including `orgId` and `action` alongside the three minimum UI fields. Produces a gated inline modal; no automatic retry/release. Current `processStreamEvent.ts:132–141` already preserves toolOutput/isError, and `AiChatMessages.tsx:298` hands that output to the card. Sidebar has no reliable org ID, and the current browser AI store discards session.orgId; never fall back to the ambient org switcher for a historical refusal.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing parser/render tests.**

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { CallerVerificationRefusal, parseRefusal } from './CallerVerificationRefusal';
import { ORG, CONTACT } from './testFixtures';
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => true }));
vi.mock('./VerifyCallerModal', () => ({ VerifyCallerModal: (p: {orgId: string; initialContactId?: string}) => <div data-testid="inline-cv" data-org={p.orgId} data-contact={p.initialContactId} /> }));
const error = { requiresCallerVerification: { orgId: ORG, action: 'reset_password', contactId: CONTACT, requiredTier: 2, reason: 'grant_consumed' } };
it('opens a modal with the refusal scope, not the ambient switcher', () => {
  render(<CallerVerificationRefusal output={JSON.stringify(error)} isError />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Verify caller'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('inline-cv')).toHaveAttribute('data-org', ORG);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('inline-cv')).toHaveAttribute('data-contact', CONTACT);
});
it('rejects missing scope, malformed payload and success output', () => {
  expect(parseRefusal({ requiresCallerVerification: { contactId: CONTACT, requiredTier: 2, reason: 'grant_consumed' } })).toBeNull();
  expect(parseRefusal('{')).toBeNull();
  render(<CallerVerificationRefusal output={error} isError={false} />);
  expect(screen.queryByText('Verify caller')).toBeNull();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.test.tsx` → missing module.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement strict parsing and the explicit renderer mount.**

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { useCallerVerificationEnabled } from '@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled';
import { VerifyCallerModal } from './VerifyCallerModal';
const schema = z.object({
  requiresCallerVerification: z.object({ orgId: z.string().uuid(), action: z.enum(['reset_password', 'disable_user']), contactId: z.string().uuid().nullable(), requiredTier: z.number().int().min(0).max(3), reason: z.enum(['no_fresh_verification', 'grant_consumed', 'subject_unmatched', 'subject_ambiguous', 'subject_mailboxes_unknown', 'tenant_mismatch', 'contact_fenced', 'requester_not_authorized', 'technician_mismatch', 'target_rebound', 'stepup_invalidated', 'administrative_disabled', 'feature_disabled']) }),
});
export function parseRefusal(output: unknown): z.infer<typeof schema> | null {
  try { const result = schema.safeParse(typeof output === 'string' ? JSON.parse(output) : output); return result.success ? result.data : null; } catch { return null; }
}
export function CallerVerificationRefusal({ output, isError }: { output: unknown; isError?: boolean }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('callerVerification'); const enabled = useCallerVerificationEnabled();
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false); const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(false);
  const refusal = isError ? parseRefusal(output) : null;
  if (!enabled || !refusal) return null;
  const required = refusal.requiresCallerVerification;
  return <aside className="rounded border p-3"><p>{t('aiRequired')}</p><p>{t('tier', { tier: required.requiredTier })}</p>
    <p>{t(/* i18n-dynamic */ `reasons.${required.reason}`, { defaultValue: t('reasons.unknown') })}</p>
    {completed && <p role="status">{t('aiRetry')}</p>}
    <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>{t('title')}</button>
    {open && <VerifyCallerModal orgId={required.orgId} initialAction={required.action} initialContactId={required.contactId ?? undefined} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} onChanged={r => setCompleted(r.status === 'verified' && !r.consumedAt && !!r.usableUntil && Date.parse(r.usableUntil) > Date.now())} />}
  </aside>;
}
```

At the tool_result branch wrap the existing card in a keyed fragment and append the refusal component. Retain `handoff` and the raw/error output unchanged:

```tsx
<div key={msg.id}>
  <AiToolCallCard toolName={msg.toolName ?? t('aiChatMessages.toolResult')} output={msg.toolOutput ?? msg.content} isError={msg.isError} handoff={msg.handoff} />
  <CallerVerificationRefusal output={msg.toolOutput ?? msg.content} isError={msg.isError} />
</div>
```

Add `import { CallerVerificationRefusal } from '../callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal';`. W05 adapters own payload preservation; an older unscoped error remains the normal error card. This parser offers only a workflow, never confers approval based on tool output. If a refused disable targeted another person, the technician must reconfirm requester and target in step 0; do not infer authorization from an AI message.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.test.tsx src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.test.tsx src/components/ai/AiToolCallCard.test.tsx` → inline refusal works and approval handoff tests remain intact.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.tsx apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationRefusal.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.tsx apps/web/src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): offer caller verification for structured AI refusals"
```

### Task 15: Wave verification, dark-mode contracts, integration and PR

**Files:** Create `apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/wave.contract.test.ts`. Modify `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts:36,540`. All other task files are verification inputs.

**Interfaces:** Consumes every W04 mount and W01–W03 backend route projection. Produces executable no-mount/no-request contracts and an open W04 PR; leaves readiness off and does not merge or close the parent issue.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing cross-surface dark-mode test.**

```tsx
// wave.contract.test.ts (use createElement so this contract keeps a .ts extension)
import { createElement } from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { afterEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { CallerVerificationEntry } from './CallerVerificationEntry';
import { VerifyCallerModal } from './VerifyCallerModal';
import { TicketVerificationBadge } from './TicketVerificationBadge';
import { ContactVerificationDrawer } from './ContactVerificationDrawer';
import { BulkDestinationAttestation } from './BulkDestinationAttestation';
import { CallerVerificationPolicyForm } from './CallerVerificationPolicyForm';
import { AdministrativeDisable } from './AdministrativeDisable';
import { CallerVerificationRefusal } from './CallerVerificationRefusal';
import { ORG, CONTACT, row } from './testFixtures';
const mocks = vi.hoisted(() => ({ fetch: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('@/stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: mocks.fetch, useAuthStore: (select: (s: unknown) => unknown) => select({ user: null }) }));
vi.mock('@/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled', () => ({ useCallerVerificationEnabled: () => false }));
afterEach(() => { cleanup(); vi.clearAllMocks(); });
it('hides every independently addressable surface and makes no API request', () => {
  const common = { orgId: ORG, onClose: vi.fn() };
  render(createElement('div', null,
    createElement(CallerVerificationEntry, { ...common, hash: 'contacts/verification' }),
    createElement(VerifyCallerModal, common),
    createElement(TicketVerificationBadge, { orgId: ORG, ticketId: row.id }),
    createElement(ContactVerificationDrawer, { ...common, contactId: CONTACT }),
    createElement(BulkDestinationAttestation, { orgId: ORG, contacts: [{ id: CONTACT, name: 'Ada' }] }),
    createElement(CallerVerificationPolicyForm, { owner: { ownerScope: 'partner' } }),
    createElement(AdministrativeDisable, { orgId: ORG, targetContactId: CONTACT, binding: { id: row.id, entraTenantId: ORG, entraOid: CONTACT, upnSnapshot: null, osPrincipal: null, revokedAt: null }, onCreated: vi.fn() }),
    createElement(CallerVerificationRefusal, { isError: true, output: { requiresCallerVerification: { orgId: ORG, action: 'disable_user', contactId: CONTACT, requiredTier: 2, reason: 'grant_consumed' } } }),
  ));
  expect(screen.queryByRole('button')).toBeNull(); expect(screen.queryByRole('dialog')).toBeNull();
  expect(mocks.fetch).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it('keeps all explicit page integrations present', () => {
  for (const [path, component] of [
    ['../tickets/TicketWorkbench.tsx', 'TicketVerificationBadge'],
    ['../settings/ContactsCard.tsx', 'ContactVerificationDrawer'],
    ['../devices/DeviceDetails.tsx', 'CallerVerificationEntry'],
    ['../settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx', 'CallerVerificationPolicyForm'],
    ['../settings/OrgSettingsPage.tsx', 'CallerVerificationPolicyForm'],
    ['../ai/AiChatMessages.tsx', 'CallerVerificationRefusal'],
  ]) expect(readFileSync(new URL(path, import.meta.url), 'utf8')).toContain(`<${component}`);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red before registering every mutation file.** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification/wave.contract.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts` → dark surfaces must pass; add an assertion to the guard's existing “finds files” test that every new mutation owner is in TARGET_GLOBS, then observe failure for absent registrations.

```ts
for (const rel of [
  'src/lib/api/callerVerification.ts',
  'src/components/callerVerification/VerifyCallerModal.tsx',
  'src/components/callerVerification/ContactVerificationDrawer.tsx',
  'src/components/callerVerification/BulkDestinationAttestation.tsx',
  'src/components/callerVerification/CallerVerificationPolicyForm.tsx',
  'src/components/callerVerification/AdministrativeDisable.tsx',
]) expect(TARGET_GLOBS).toContain(rel);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the remaining guard registrations.** Add those six exact strings once (client already added in Task 1); increase the rebased guarded count by five, 126 → 131 on this baseline. Do not register legacy `mfaStepUp.ts` as an adopted file: its old callers retain the existing transport, while the new injected transport is lexically guarded in callerVerification.ts. Do not add any allowlist or exemption. The guard resolves imported API wrappers and detects future bare mutations in the components.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run all targeted, type and contract checks from root.**

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/callerVerification src/lib/api/callerVerification.test.ts src/lib/api/callerVerification.workstation.test.ts src/lib/useCallerVerificationEnabled.test.tsx src/stores/featuresStore.test.ts src/lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/tickets/TicketWorkbench.test.tsx src/components/tickets/TicketFeed.test.tsx src/components/settings/ContactsCard.test.tsx src/components/organizations/record/orgRecordTabs.test.ts src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.hashNavigation.test.tsx src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/settings/OrgSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/ai/AiChatMessages.test.tsx src/components/ai/AiToolCallCard.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/i18n src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit && npx astro check)
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/config.test.ts src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts)
```

Expected: all pass with nonzero file counts; no missing translations, module imports or Astro props. W01 route supplements and W05's administrative operation must be checked against their merged source rather than assumed from these fixtures. The W02-owned `callerVerification.workstation.test.ts` (W02 Task 14) connects its real Hono suggestions route to this browser client; require that combined-wave test, alongside Task 4's modal HTTP-load test, before activation. W05 Task 13 owns the real post-consumption outbound-failure/reuse regression; W04's tests assert the HTTP consumer and UI only. No W04 Go/helper code changed, so a new agent race run is not required here; W02 owns `cd agent && go test -race ./internal/heartbeat/...`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run live-DB contracts; always tear down the private stack.**

```bash
pnpm test-stack up
trap 'pnpm test-stack down' EXIT
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/callerVerification.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/orgLifecycleFoundations.integration.test.ts)
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.rls-coverage.ts src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts)
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.rls.ts src/__tests__/integration/rls.integration.test.ts)
pnpm test-stack down
trap - EXIT
```

W01 Task 15 defines the exact new `callerVerification.integration.test.ts` path included above. `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` is excluded from the normal integration config and uses its dedicated `vitest.config.rls-coverage.ts`; do not combine it with the truncate-based fixture runner. Require positive own-org controls and cross-org/sibling-site refusals for history, methods, bindings, destination attestation, override and ticket freshness. W04 does not claim that mocked web tests establish RLS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit verification and open the wave PR.** Read actual parent and sub-issue numbers from the implementation task into `CV_PARENT` and `CV_SUB` before using these commands; they are required issue inputs, not fabricated values. On the pre-created branch the exact branch name is mechanically asserted. No commit/PR command in this plan runs during plan authoring.

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations | sort | tail -1
git diff --check
git add apps/web/src/components/callerVerification/wave.contract.test.ts apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
git commit -m "test(web): verify dark caller workflow and mutation contracts"

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.** D2/script and large codes → Task 5; D4 aggregate and selected-device availability/tier → Tasks 1/4/10; D6 floor/provenance/ignored → Tasks 11/12; D11 bindings → Task 8; D12 destination establishment/individual attestation → Task 8; bulk contact-list attestation with partial failures → Task 9 Steps 6–10; D13 single-use/technician/freshness and consumed-then-failed re-verification → Tasks 1/3/5/6; D15 requester/target and interactive admin → Tasks 4/13; D16 dark mounting → Tasks 2/15. Ticket, contact row, contact drawer and device header each have explicit mount tasks (7/9/10). W01 system comments already render in TicketFeed. AI refusal → Task 14. Eight actual translations and parity → Task 3. Final verification covers targeted, contract, type and integration suites.

**Cross-wave findings.** #1 → Task 1 requires W02's corrected `{data}` suggestions envelope; Task 4 drives the combined load through the browser client and Task 15 runs W02's real-route/client test. #5 → Task 1 validates and preserves all five W01 HTTP projection fields on start/get/cancel/attest/admin/history/ticket; W05 adds consumed-intent status without changing index interfaces. #6 → Tasks 1/11 consume `{row,defaults,baseline,effective}` for both ownership scopes and both GET/PUT; null fields use defaults or partner baseline, separately from effective values. #7 → Tasks 1/8 consume the W01 directory envelope, use returned tenant/OID only, and clear choices on unavailable/error responses. #8 → Tasks 1/4/10 preserve per-device readiness, disable unavailable options and reject unavailable/missing preselection with a ready-device positive control. #16 → Tasks 1/3/5/6 cover translated failed-action guidance, polling transitions, badge output and an explicit fresh challenge; W05 owns the live release/outbound-failure, retained-marker and reuse-refusal test. #18 → Task 9 implements visible-page contact selection and explicit per-destination attestation through the authorized endpoint; partial failures retry without replaying successes. Task 15 registers the bulk mutation owner and dark-mode surface. Backend Graph, projection, authorization and release behavior remain owned by the sibling plans, not simulated by web fixtures.

**Type and state consistency.** API methods use canonical contact IDs, never portal user IDs; partner policy carries no browser-selected partner ID. UI identity, match/reverse codes and step-up data are never persisted in URL state. Polls are cancellable, sequential and scoped; components remount on org/subject changes. The ticket badge uses server freshness, actual consumed action and consumed-intent status. An absent/null intent status is unknown; consumption alone never means execution failed. Bulk attestation never promotes establishment locally or carries selected IDs across org/page/filter changes. Administrative disable proves an existing factor, never synthesized release-context MFA. AI refusals never auto-retry an identity mutation.

**Review discipline.** Source paths and current integration seams were read before writing; new files are marked Create, not cited as existing implementations. Code fences define each new interface, component, helper, mutation and failing-test assertion. Planned implementation commands are not execution evidence. This plan authoring changes only this Markdown file and makes no product changes or commits.
