# Caller verification (anti-vishing) — design

Status: draft v5 for review · Owner: Todd · Date: 2026-09-18 · Revised: 2026-09-19
(four Codex gpt-6-astra xhigh passes folded in — see "Review notes")

## Problem

Every named help-desk breach since 2023 (MGM, Caesars, M&S, Co-op) began with
a phone call to a service desk asking for a password or MFA reset. Trained
listeners cannot distinguish current voice clones from real voices, so nothing
that travels inside the voice channel is evidence of identity: caller ID, the
voice, employee ID, manager's name, date of birth, or knowledge of a ticket
number. The only defence that holds is moving the proof onto a channel the
caller does not control and making the risky action refuse without it.

Breeze has the primitives and none of the orchestration:

- The agent and helper already ship a branded, correlated, always-on-top
  prompt for remote-session consent (`agent/internal/heartbeat/consent_gate.go`,
  `apps/helper/src-tauri/src/ipc/desktop.rs`) that carries technician name,
  org name and a timeout.
- Twilio SMS and transactional email exist (`services/twilio.ts`, `services/email.ts`).
- Customer-side people are `contacts` rows with `email`, `phone`, `mobile`, and
  tickets already carry `requesterContactId`.
- `m365_reset_password` and `m365_disable_user` are exactly the vishing payload,
  and today nothing in their path asks who requested the change.

## Goals

1. A technician on the phone can, in one click from a ticket, a contact, or a
   device, challenge the caller on an out-of-band channel and see a pass/fail
   inside two minutes.
2. The caller can confirm what is being requested and by whom (request
   confirmation). See D2 for what this does and does not prove.
3. Risky identity actions refuse unless a fresh, **single-use** verification of
   sufficient assurance exists for the **canonical** subject, bound to the
   requesting technician and to the action. Enforcement is server-side, at the
   point the action is released and again at every place a Graph mutation is
   issued (three backends, D5).
4. Every attempt, pass, fail, and "that is not me" is on the ticket timeline and
   in the tamper-evident audit log; a "not me" opens a security incident,
   fences the subject, and cancels everything for that person that has not yet
   been dispatched.
5. Partner-wide policy is a **floor**: it decides which actions need which
   assurance and how long a verification stays fresh, and an org row can only
   tighten it. No policy row means the gate is **on** with defaults, never off.
6. Nothing user-visible ships before the gate and the rejection path are live.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Entra Temporary Access Pass, Verified ID / Face Check, Microsoft Authenticator
  push, Teams messages. No new Graph scopes beyond what the directory sync
  already holds.
- Telephony or caller-ID integration.
- A general contact-to-device link table. v1 has a narrow contact-to-principal
  binding (D11) for the workstation tier only.
- Customer portal passkeys or TOTP.
- Gating Google Workspace or on-prem AD resets. The gate is generic; only the
  two M365 tools are wired in v1.
- Detecting resets performed outside Breeze (Microsoft admin portal, a script
  on a DC). The gate is a workflow control inside Breeze, not an enforcement
  boundary around the tenant. A detector that flags Entra password-change
  events with no matching fresh verification is the honest complement and a
  follow-up.
- Non-console sessions on RDS / multi-session hosts for the workstation tier.
  The Tauri helper is console-bound (`sessionbroker/broker.go` ~L2685); those
  sessions report `unavailable` in v1. A native per-session prompt is a
  follow-up.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | New table `caller_verifications` keyed on `contacts`. Not a contact axis on `approval_requests`. | `approval_requests` is a technician-assurance ledger (`user_id NOT NULL`, device-bound factor enum, intent CAS semantics). Different subject, different factors, no fan-out. |
| D2 | One "challenge card" for every method: partner branding, technician name, **the exact action and target** ("reset the password for j.smith@acme.com"), a reverse code, three candidate numbers of which one matches what the technician sees, and "This is not me". The caller never reads a code back. **Number matching is request confirmation, not proof of the technician's identity and not relay-proof.** | A read-back OTP is relayable outright. Number matching removes reflex approval and forces the user to see what is being requested. It does **not** stop an attacker who is on the phone with the real technician from repeating the number to the victim on a parallel call (threat 2); the card therefore names the technician, the action and the target, and the script never claims the code "proves" anything. A branded page reached from a link the caller supplied is not an independent trust anchor either; the strong reverse check is the caller ringing the MSP back on a number they already hold, and the card says so. |
| D3 | The workstation tier is a **new** agent command `caller_verify` on the consent-gate seam, not `notify_user`. | `notify_user` as shipped cannot render it: Windows builds a fixed two-button `MessageBoxTimeoutW` (`userhelper/notify_prompt_windows.go`), macOS caps at three buttons, Linux returns no decision, and the agent waits 10 s without forwarding a timeout (`heartbeat/handlers_user.go`). The consent gate already renders a branded Tauri window with technician and org name and a correlated timeout on all three platforms. Cost: an agent and helper release. |
| D4 | Assurance tiers: 3 workstation **bound** (the answering OS principal is bound to the contact, D11) or administrative step-up (D15), 2 SMS/email link to an **established** destination (D12), 1 workstation **unbound**, callback attestation, or a link to a non-established destination. Default gate is tier ≥ 2 for both M365 actions, so an unbound workstation never satisfies it on defaults. Tier is **recomputed at release** from the current policy, binding and destination state; the value frozen on the row is informational. Email never counts toward resetting the mailbox it was sent to, judged against the subject's directory identity, not a string compare. | A technician-selected device and username is possession of *some* managed session in the org, not this contact's; that is tier 1 evidence, on a par with "I rang a number". Only a principal binding lifts it to tier 3. A link proves possession of the phone or mailbox of record, but only if that record predates the call and was set by a human. Recomputing at release means a method the partner disables, or a destination that stops being established, stops satisfying the gate without a revocation sweep. |
| D5 | Gate lives in `actionIntents/revalidateRelease.ts`, with a UX pre-check at intent creation and defense-in-depth checks inside **all three** M365 mutation backends: `m365DirectGraph.invokeDirect`, `m365ControlPlane/writeActionService.executeM365WriteActionByOrg`, and the Delegant broker path (`aiToolsM365.call()` → `invokeDelegantTool`). | `revalidateRelease` is already the single fail-closed check both release paths run, and freshness is a release-time property. `aiToolsM365.ts` selects among three backends (`direct`, `controlPlane`, `delegant`); the first draft gated two. Any future caller that skips the intent layer still refuses. Behavioural tests prove every backend issues zero mutation calls on refusal; a source-reference contract test is not sufficient on its own. |
| D6 | Policy is a dedicated dual-ownership table `caller_verification_policies` (`org_id` XOR `partner_id`). Resolution in two steps: **baseline** = partner row with built-in defaults filling only fields the partner row leaves null; **effective** = baseline tightened field-by-field by the org row (org values that would loosen are ignored and reported). Not a config-policy feature link. | Every config-policy resolver in `services/featureConfigResolver.ts` starts from a device hierarchy. This feature is scoped to an org and a contact and often has no device. "Closest row wins whole" (v1) let an org `settings:write` holder set tier 0 and defeat the partner; `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` only governs partner-owned rows. Plain strictest-wins over defaults too (v2) made the partner unable to loosen anything (`max(default 2, partner 0)` is 2). Baseline-then-tighten gives the partner full control and the org tighten-only, with no new authority model. |
| D7 | No `ticket_id` and no `device_id` column. Snapshots `ticket_ref`, `ticket_number`, `workstation_device_ref`, `device_hostname` carry the correlation with **no FK and no `device_id`/`ticket_id` column name**. | A table carrying `device_id`, `ticket_id` and `org_id` would be the first child selected by both org-move walkers (#4657 deadlock class). Worse, `breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()` (migration `2026-10-14-100000-ai-operator-thin-slice.sql`) discovers device children **by the uuid column name `device_id`**, FK or not, and rewrites `org_id` on a device move, which would then trip the contact/org composite FK. Renaming the snapshot column keeps the table out of both walkers; the badge and timeline resolve by `ticket_ref`. |
| D8 | "Not me" opens an `incidents` row (p2), places a **subject fence** on the contact, cancels every not-yet-dispatched action intent for the subject through a **system-scoped internal revocation** (not `cancelActionIntent`), reports already-executing intents honestly in the incident, and notifies the partner. | `alerts.device_id` is `NOT NULL`, so alerts cannot represent a device-less rejection. `cancelActionIntent` (`intentService.ts` ~L2289) requires requester-or-approver authorization, which a public challenge response does not have, and it only reaches `pending_approval`/`approved`; the release worker claims `executing` before revalidation (`intentReleaseWorker.ts` ~L904). So cancellation alone cannot stop a release already past CAS; the fence is checked again inside every Graph backend at dispatch, which is the last point before the irreversible boundary. A vishing campaign hits many orgs of one MSP, so the partner hears about it. |
| D9 | Delivery is asynchronous: start returns 202 and the UI polls. The `device_commands` row is created **in the same transaction as the verification row**, before anything is sent; the result is consumed by **one** idempotent handler in `services/commandResultHandlers.ts`, which both the WebSocket and HTTP transports already dispatch through. | Holding a request transaction across a two-minute agent round trip pins a pooled connection (#1105). `dispatchCommandToAgent` (`agentCommandRelay.ts`) transmits; it does not create the persisted ownership row, so "send then record the id" races an early result. The agent also posts results over HTTP (`heartbeat.go` ~L6084, `routes/agents/commands.ts`), and the WS path drops a duplicate once HTTP has terminalised (`agentWs.ts` ~L2107), so a WS-only hook loses decisions. |
| D10 | Public challenge page `/verify/:token`, patterned on Quick Support. | `routes/supportPublic.ts` already solves the same shape: token is the credential, tight `withSystemDbAccessContext`, per-IP limits, a two-tier miss budget, one atomic single-use transition. |
| D11 | **Canonical subject** is an Entra principal `(entra_tenant_id, entra_oid)`, independent of any backend connection, recorded in a new table `caller_verification_subject_bindings`, written only by the **Graph-backed** directory sync or by an explicit technician attestation — never by CSV/API import. Every backend validates at dispatch that its connection's tenant (`m365_connections.tenant_id`, `delegant_m365_connections.m365_tenant_id`) equals the pinned tenant. The gate resolves subjects by binding only; there is no email-string fallback. Ambiguity fails closed. All references from `caller_verifications` to bindings, destinations and intents are **composite FKs carrying `org_id`** (and `contact_id` where the target has one). | `contacts.email` is deliberately non-unique (`schema/contacts.ts` ~L86); the importer accepts uploaded external identifiers (`services/contacts/import.ts` ~L351), so an `entra` link from a file is a label, not evidence; the M365 tools resolve UPN → OID and drop the UPN before mutating (`aiToolsM365.ts` ~L258), so a UPN compare can guard a different user than the one mutated and misses aliases. Three connection tables exist (`m365_connections` with per-profile rows, `delegant_m365_connections`), so a binding keyed on one connection cannot serve all backends; tenant+OID is the identity, the connection is the route. A connection id survives a tenant change (`routes/m365.ts` ~L166), hence the tenant check at dispatch. Plain uuid FKs would let an org-A verification reference an org-B binding under RLS on the owning row only; `contact_external_links` already uses the composite form for this reason (`schema/contacts.ts` ~L125). |
| D12 | **Destination provenance** is its own table `caller_verification_destinations`: one row per (contact, kind, value hash) with `set_at`, `set_by_user_id`, `source` and optional `attested_at`. Every contact write path (CRUD route, import, inbound email, AI tool) records the change through one helper. "Established" is computed from this table, never from `contacts.updated_at` or the audit log. | The existing contact audit events record field *names*, roles and link metadata, not destination values (`services/contacts/audit.ts` ~L60/L96, `routes/orgContacts.ts` ~L351), so they cannot show that a phone number was unchanged for N days. AI-created contacts carry the technician's `userId` (`aiToolsOrgs.ts` ~L518), so "created by a human" is not derivable from ownership. Editing an unrelated field must not establish the phone. |
| D13 | A verification is a **single-use grant bound to** the verified requester, the **authorised target** `(tenant, oid)`, the initiating technician, and an `action_scope` (`reset_password`, `disable_user`, or `any`). Consumption is **post-claim**: the release path claims `executing` as today, then one transaction runs revalidation, the fence check and the consume CAS (`consumed_at IS NULL`), then dispatches. Consumption is recorded as `consumed_at` plus a **snapshot** `consumed_intent_ref` (no FK: `action_intents` stays with the loser org on merge, `orgMergeRegistry.ts` ~L194, so an FK would break repointing). If revalidation refuses, the intent fails and the grant is untouched. If dispatch fails after consumption, the intent fails, the grant stays consumed, and the technician is told to re-verify. Same-intent retry is idempotent (`consumed_intent_ref = this intent` passes). The **irreversible boundary** is `action_intents.dispatch_started_at`, set in the same short transaction as the backend's final fence check immediately before the outbound call; a rejection that lands after it reports the intent as dispatched, one that lands before it wins because the fence read and the marker are serialised on advisory locks taken on **both** the requester's and the target's binding ids, always in ascending uuid order. Cross-technician use is off by default. Rebinding, contact merge, device move or a fence mark outstanding grants `revoked`. | v1 selected by contact, tier, status and age only, so an impersonator ringing a second technician inherited a grant and one approval authorised repeated actions. v2 said "same transaction as the release CAS", which is impossible: both the worker (`intentReleaseWorker.ts` ~L904) and the inline path (`aiAgentSdk.ts` ~L1388 → ~L1455) claim `executing` before calling revalidation. Post-claim consumption with explicit failure semantics is honest about that ordering. |
| D14 | The target is pinned end to end as `(entra_tenant_id, entra_oid)`: the intent stores it at creation, the grant carries it, each backend checks its connection's tenant equals it and passes the OID (never the original identifier) to Graph or the executor; UPN is display-only after resolution. Expiry, tenant, OID and the fence are re-evaluated at dispatch inside each backend, immediately before the outbound call. | `writeActionService.executeM365WriteActionByOrg` forwards the original identifier (`writeActionService.ts` ~L159) and the executor re-resolves it (`m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/writeActions.ts` ~L56); a UPN reassignment or a connection re-pointed at another tenant between verification and execution separates the verified identity from the mutated one. |
| D15 | Every grant names two identities: the **requester** (the contact on the call, who is verified) and the **target** (the account acted upon). For `reset_password` they must be the same binding. For `disable_user` they may differ when the requester is an **org-level** contact (`site_id IS NULL`) holding a role in `disable_user_authorizer_roles` (default `{admin}`, an existing `CONTACT_ROLES` value in `services/contacts/types.ts`; `is_primary` confers nothing). The challenge card names the target, so the requester confirms *that* account. A separate **administrative disable** exists for offboarding and containment: the technician performs an interactive MFA step-up (`POST /auth/mfa/step-up`, `services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts`, new operation `caller_verification_administrative_disable` with a resource digest of org + target + reason), and presenting the grant writes a durable `caller_verifications` row with `method='administrative_stepup'`, tier 3, `action_scope='disable_user'`, the target binding, the reason and `initiated_by_user_id`. The row has **no requester binding** and is not a challenge method: it is exempt from `allowed_methods`, governed instead by `allow_administrative_disable` (default true, org may only turn it off), and the gate's requester and destination checks are replaced for it by the administrative eligibility checks (initiating technician still holds `ORGS_WRITE`, step-up session and MFA epoch still valid). Never for `reset_password`. | Requiring the target's own cooperation to disable their account blocks offboarding and compromise containment and would push partners to tier 0. v2 conflated requester and target, so a manager's grant could never satisfy a target-OID check at dispatch. v2 also relied on "fresh MFA" at release, but the release actor context synthesises `mfa: true` (`actionIntents/actorContext.ts` ~L276) and `requireMfa` is a boolean check with no freshness (`middleware/auth.ts` ~L911); the step-up grant is the existing primitive that proves a factor interactively and single-uses it, and turning it into a grant row keeps one dispatch contract. `is_primary` is the headline contact for an org **or a site** (`schema/contacts.ts` ~L59), so it must not confer org-wide authority. |
| D16 | Feature is dark until W05: server flag `CALLER_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` (default false) hides every entry point and 404s the authenticated routes; per-method availability additionally requires the agent/helper capability (D17). | Green "Caller verified" badges without a live gate are a false sense of security. |
| D17 | Helper selection mirrors `consentUISessionForTarget` (`consent_gate.go` ~L159): resolve the target user's **console** Windows session, then pick the Tauri **assist** helper in that session with scope `consent_ui` **and** the `callerVerify` capability. No such helper → `undeliverable(helper_outdated)`; the native user-helper fallback is not used because it cannot render the card. Timeout is never approval. | Older Tauri helpers **silently ignore** unknown IPC messages (`apps/helper/src-tauri/src/ipc/client.rs` ~L365). `SessionForUser` (`broker.go` ~L929) prefers the native `user`-role helper, while Tauri authenticates as `assist` (`client.rs` ~L147), so a username-first lookup would pick the helper that can never carry the capability and report an up-to-date install as outdated. |
| D18 | Merge and erasure: `caller_verifications` and `caller_verification_destinations` are `repoint`; `caller_verification_subject_bindings` is `custom`: before rows move, for every `(entra_tenant_id, entra_oid)` or `os_principal` present in both orgs, both bindings are `revoked_at` and `caller_verification.binding_conflict` is audited (the merge never picks a contact); then rows repoint; then a post-step marks pending verifications `expired` and unconsumed grants of loser-org contacts `revoked`. `caller_verification_policies` is `keep-survivor`. All four in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`, `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`, and the policy table additionally in `DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES` and `XOR_OWNERSHIP_DUAL_AXIS_TABLES`. | Every cascade table needs exactly one merge classification or `orgMerge.ts` (~L1083) throws. `repoint` and `custom` are alternatives in the registry (`orgMergeRegistry.ts` ~L22) and plain repoint is only the UPDATE (`orgMerge.ts` ~L709), so a per-org unique on principals would raise 23505 mid-merge before any post-step ran. The SELECT-branch coverage test enumerates `XOR_OWNERSHIP_DUAL_AXIS_TABLES` (`rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` ~L1617). |

Advisor quorum: v1 came from a Claude reviewer (Codex out of usage on
2026-09-18). v2 folds in the Codex gpt-6-astra `xhigh` review of 2026-09-19
(verdict: rework), whose file:line claims were re-read before adoption. The
two blockers became D11 and D4/D13; see "Review notes".

## Data model

All new tables are tenancy shape 1 (direct `org_id`, `breeze_has_org_access`)
except the policy table (dual ownership). No json/jsonb/bytea anywhere.

### `caller_verifications`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid pk | |
| `org_id` | uuid not null | RLS `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)` |
| `contact_id` | uuid not null | composite FK `(contact_id, org_id) → contacts(id, org_id)` **DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE**, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `requester_binding_id` | uuid null | composite FK `(requester_binding_id, contact_id, org_id) → caller_verification_subject_bindings(id, contact_id, org_id)` `ON DELETE SET NULL`; the verified person's Entra binding; `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, `ON DELETE SET NULL (requester_binding_id)` (column-specific, PG15+); non-null at creation is enforced by the service for `action_scope <> 'any'` except `administrative_stepup`, and a later null makes the grant unusable (`subject_unmatched`), which is the intended effect of the requester's binding disappearing |
| `target_binding_id` | uuid null | composite FK `(target_binding_id, org_id) → caller_verification_subject_bindings(id, org_id)` `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, `ON DELETE SET NULL (target_binding_id)`; the account acted upon (D15); equals the requester binding for self-service; non-null at creation enforced by the service; a later null → `target_rebound`. No NOT NULL CHECK, so hard-deleting target contact B (`services/contacts/crud.ts` ~L646) cascades B's bindings without being blocked by requester A's history row; the `target_entra_*` snapshots keep the record readable |
| `target_entra_tenant_id`, `target_entra_oid` | varchar(64) null | snapshot of the target identity at creation so a later rebinding is detectable (grant → `revoked`) |
| `initiated_by_user_id` | uuid not null | technician; FK `users(id)` `RESTRICT` plus `technician_label` snapshot |
| `technician_label` | varchar(255) not null | display name frozen at creation |
| `action_scope` | enum `caller_verification_action_scope` | `reset_password`, `disable_user`, `any` |
| `target_label` | varchar(320) null | what the card shows ("reset the password for j.smith@…"); snapshot |
| `method` | enum `caller_verification_method` | `workstation`, `sms`, `email`, `callback_attestation`, `administrative_stepup` |
| `reason` | text null | required for `administrative_stepup` (min 20 chars) |
| `stepup_session_id`, `stepup_auth_epoch`, `stepup_mfa_epoch`, `stepup_verified_at` | text / int / int / timestamptz null | `administrative_stepup` only. Session id and both epochs are the bindings the step-up grant carries (`StepUpGrant`, `mfaStepUpGrant.ts`); the grant has no proof timestamp and `consumeStepUpGrant` returns a boolean, so `stepup_verified_at = now()` at the administrative route, which is within the grant's own mint TTL of the factor proof. The administrative row's freshness is aged from `stepup_verified_at`, not `decided_at` |
| `status` | enum `caller_verification_status` | `pending`, `verified`, `rejected_by_user`, `wrong_choice`, `expired`, `undeliverable`, `cancelled`, `revoked` |
| `tier` | smallint not null | frozen at creation by the rules in "Tiers" |
| `tier_reason` | varchar(64) not null | `bound_principal`, `unbound_principal`, `destination_established`, `destination_recent`, `attestation` |
| `match_value` | char(2) not null | the number the technician sees |
| `decoy_values` | char(2)[] not null | two other candidates, fixed so the card is stable across reloads |
| `reverse_code` | char(4) not null | technician reads it aloud; the card shows it |
| `challenge_token_hash` | char(64) null | sha256 of a 32-byte link token; link methods only; unique partial index |
| `destination_id` | uuid null | composite FK `(destination_id, contact_id, org_id) → caller_verification_destinations(id, contact_id, org_id)` `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, `ON DELETE SET NULL (destination_id)`; link methods; `destination_redacted` keeps the record readable |
| `destination_redacted` | varchar(64) null | `+44 •••• ••12`, `a•••@acme.com` |
| `workstation_device_ref` | uuid null | snapshot, **no FK, deliberately not named `device_id`** (D7) |
| `device_hostname` | varchar(255) null | snapshot |
| `os_username` | varchar(255) null | the OS user the prompt was targeted at |
| `os_principal_observed` | varchar(255) null | SID / uid reported back by the agent for the answering session |
| `agent_command_id` | uuid null | FK → `device_commands(id)` `ON DELETE SET NULL`; unique partial index; written in the same transaction as the row (D9) |
| `ticket_ref` | uuid null | snapshot, no FK, not named `ticket_id` (D7) |
| `ticket_number` | varchar(32) null | snapshot for display |
| `attempt_no` | smallint not null | 1-based per contact within the attempt window; drives the cap |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz not null | workstation: `now() + workstation_timeout_seconds`; links: `+ 10 min`; attestation: `now()` |
| `decided_at` | timestamptz null | |
| `decided_from_ip` | inet null | link methods |
| `consumed_intent_ref` | uuid null | snapshot, **no FK** (D13); set by the consume CAS |
| `consumed_at` | timestamptz null | the consumption marker; a cleared ref never makes a grant reusable because this stays set |
| `attestation_note` | text null | `callback_attestation` only |
| `created_at` | timestamptz not null | |

Indexes: `(org_id, contact_id, created_at desc)`; unique partial on
`challenge_token_hash`; unique partial on `agent_command_id`; partial on
`(contact_id, status, consumed_at) WHERE status='verified' AND consumed_at IS NULL`
for the gate lookup. `action_intents` gains `dispatch_started_at timestamptz null` (D13).

Export policy: `included` for everything except `challenge_token_hash`,
`match_value`, `decoy_values`, `reverse_code` → `excludedSensitive`.

### `caller_verification_subject_bindings` (D11)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `org_id`, `contact_id` | composite FK to `contacts(id, org_id)` deferrable, cascade; unique `(id, org_id)` and `(id, contact_id, org_id)` as composite-FK targets |
| `entra_tenant_id` varchar(64) null, `entra_oid` varchar(64) null | the canonical subject; unique `(org_id, entra_tenant_id, entra_oid) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`. **No connection FK**: the connection is the route, not the identity (D11) |
| `upn_snapshot` varchar(320) null | display and workstation matching; refreshed by sync, never used for authorisation |
| `os_principal` varchar(255) null | Windows SID, or `uid:<n>@<hostname>` on macOS/Linux; unique `(org_id, os_principal) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL` |
| `os_username` varchar(255) null | |
| `source` enum | `directory_sync`, `technician_attested`, `observed_login` |
| `established_at` timestamptz not null | `directory_sync`/`technician_attested`: when written; `observed_login`: first observation |
| `attested_by_user_id` uuid null, `attested_at` timestamptz null | |
| `revoked_at` timestamptz null | set when sync no longer sees the OID, a technician removes it, or a merge finds a collision |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | |

Writers: **only** the Graph-backed directory sync path of the contact import
(the branch that received the user object from Graph, keyed by `id` and the
connection's verified `tenant_id`) writes `directory_sync` rows; the CSV/API
import path (`services/contacts/import.ts` ~L351 accepts uploaded external
ids) is explicitly excluded and a unit test asserts an uploaded `entra` link
creates no binding. The contact drawer offers "Bind to Entra user" (picker
backed by a Graph read, `technician_attested`, requires `ORGS_WRITE` + MFA,
audited). The agent reports `(sid|uid, username, upn?)` on the `caller_verify`
result and on login observation, which writes or refreshes an
`observed_login` row **only when the UPN matches an existing directory
binding for that contact**. An OS principal with no UPN match is never bound
automatically. Ambiguity rules: one OID → one contact per org; a second claim
marks both `revoked_at` and audits `caller_verification.binding_conflict`.

Export policy: all `included` (`upn_snapshot`, `os_principal` are identifiers,
not secrets). Merge: `custom` (see D18).

### `caller_verification_destinations` (D12)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `org_id`, `contact_id` | composite FK, deferrable, cascade; unique `(id, contact_id, org_id)` as composite-FK target |
| `kind` enum | `email`, `mobile` |

One helper `recordDestinationChange(contactId, kind, value, {source, userId})`
is called from every write path (`routes/orgContacts.ts`, `services/contacts/import.ts`,
`services/inboundEmail/resolveOrg.ts`, `aiToolsOrgs.ts`, portal profile edit).
A contract test greps every writer of `contacts.email` / `contacts.mobile` for
the call. Backfill: the migration inserts one row per current value with
`source='import'`, `set_at = contacts.updated_at`; those rows count as
established only once attested (conservative default; partners attest in bulk
from the contact list).

Export policy: `value_hash` → `excludedSensitive`, rest `included`. Merge:
`repoint`.

### `caller_verification_policies` (dual ownership, #2135 playbook)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `org_id` null, `partner_id` null | `caller_verification_policies_one_owner_chk ((org_id IS NULL) <> (partner_id IS NULL))`; unique on each owner |
| `required_tier_reset_password` smallint | default 2, 0..3; `0` disables the gate for that action — only meaningful on the partner row (D6) |
| `required_tier_disable_user` smallint | default 2 |
| `disable_user_authorizer_roles` text[] | default `{admin}`; roles an org-level non-target requester must hold (D15); org row may only remove roles (intersection) |
| `verification_ttl_minutes` int | default 30, 5..240 |
| `allowed_methods` text[] | default the four challenge methods; `administrative_stepup` is not a member and not governed here |
| `workstation_timeout_seconds` int | default 120, 30..300 |
| `destination_min_age_days` int | default 7, 0..90 |
| `require_attested_destination` boolean | default false; true → only attested rows are established |
| `require_ticket` boolean | default false; enforced at **initiation** (D7 / API) |
| `allow_cross_technician_use` boolean | default false (D13) |
| `allow_administrative_disable` boolean | default true; org row may only set false (D15) |
| `max_attempts_per_hour` smallint | default 3 per contact |
| `cooling_off_hours` int | default 24 after a rejection |
| `created_at`, `updated_at`, `updated_by_user_id` | |

RLS: one dual-axis `FOR ALL` policy (system OR org access OR partner access)
plus the separate `FOR SELECT`-only partner-wide branch
`USING (org_id IS NULL AND partner_id = public.breeze_current_partner_id())`
(template `2026-10-05-110000-config-policy-partner-wide-select.sql`). Registered
in `DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES` **and** `XOR_OWNERSHIP_DUAL_AXIS_TABLES`, and
**not** in `PARTNER_WIDE_SELECT_BRANCH_EXEMPT`. Writes: partner rows gated on
`canManagePartnerWidePolicies`; org rows on `ORGS_WRITE` + MFA (matches
contacts). All policy columns are nullable; null means "inherit".

**Resolution (D6).** Baseline = partner row, with built-in defaults filling
only null fields. Effective = baseline tightened by the org row per field,
with any loosening org value ignored and reported: tiers `max`, TTL and
workstation timeout `min`, `destination_min_age_days` `max`,
`require_attested_destination` and `require_ticket` `OR`,
`allow_cross_technician_use` and `allow_administrative_disable` `AND`, `allowed_methods` and
`disable_user_authorizer_roles` intersection, attempt cap `min`, cooling-off
`max`. The API returns the effective policy with a per-field "from"
(`default` / `partner` / `org`) and an `ignored` list, so the UI can show why
an org field is read-only.

Export policy: `required_tier_reset_password` matches `SUSPICIOUS_NAME_PARTS`
(`password`) → `reviewedIncluded`; rest `included`. Merge: `keep-survivor`.

Lowering any tier, setting `destination_min_age_days` to 0, or enabling
`allow_cross_technician_use` on the partner row writes `audit_logs` action
`caller_verification.policy_weakened` with before and after values. Tightening
policy does not revoke issued grants; the gate re-evaluates against the
*current* policy at release, so a grant that no longer meets the tier simply
stops satisfying it.

### Registration checklist (same PR as the migration)

- RLS enabled + forced on all four; shape 1 auto-discovered for three, policy
  table in `DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES`.
- `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`: all four, alphabetical, children before
  `contacts`, `device_commands`, `m365_connections`, `action_intents`.
- `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`: every column as classified above.
- `orgMergeRegistry`: `caller_verifications` and destinations `repoint`,
  bindings `custom` (collision revocation before the move, grant revocation
  after), policies `keep-survivor`.
- No column named `device_id` or `ticket_id` → not in any device cascade list
  and not discovered by `breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()`. A unit test
  asserts the schema has no such column on these tables.

## Tiers and the establishment rule

| Method | Tier | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| workstation | 3 | the answering session's `(os_principal, upn)` matches a non-revoked binding for this contact (D11) |
| administrative_stepup | 3 | technician MFA step-up grant consumed (D15); `disable_user` only; exempt from `allowed_methods`, requires `allow_administrative_disable` |
| sms | 2 | current `mobile` destination row is established |
| email | 2 | current `email` destination row is established **and** the destination is not one of the target's mailbox addresses (see below) |
| workstation | 1 | delivered to the technician-selected `os_username` on the chosen device and answered, but no binding matches |
| sms / email | 1 | destination not established |
| callback_attestation | 1 | always; the technician records they called the number of record |

The tier is recomputed at release (D4) from the current policy, the row's
method, the binding state and the destination's establishment state; a method
removed from `allowed_methods` yields tier 0.

A destination is **established** when its current `caller_verification_destinations`
row has `set_at <= now() - destination_min_age_days`, `source = 'technician'`
or `attested_at IS NOT NULL`, and (if `require_attested_destination`)
`attested_at IS NOT NULL`. Inbound-email, import and AI-written values are not
established until attested. This closes the "email the ticket mailbox, become
a contact, verify yourself" path.

**Same-mailbox rule.** For an M365 action, an `email` verification never
counts if the destination equals any of the **target's** `mail`,
`userPrincipalName` or `proxyAddresses` (SMTP entries, case-insensitive). The
gate fetches these from Graph for the pinned OID at release using the
directory-read scope the sync already holds. `proxyAddresses` is not in the
current `m365.user.get` projection allowlist
(`packages/shared/src/m365/readActions.ts`, `M365_READ_ACTION_FIELDS`), so W03
adds a dedicated read action `m365.user.mailboxes` projecting exactly
`id`, `userPrincipalName`, `mail`, `proxyAddresses`, for all three backends.
If the read fails, the gate refuses `subject_mailboxes_unknown` rather than
falling back to a string compare.

The modal shows the computed tier per method before the technician picks, with
the reason when it is lower than expected ("mobile updated 2 days ago",
"no Entra binding for this contact — workstation caps at tier 2").

## Service layer

`apps/api/src/services/callerVerification/`

- `service.ts` — `start`, `cancel`, `attest`, `get`, `listForContact`,
  `freshForSubject`, `createAdministrative`. `start` takes the requester
  contact and, for `action_scope <> 'any'`, a target (`targetContactId`, or
  `targetBindingId`); resolves both to bindings; enforces the D15 rule at
  initiation (same binding for `reset_password`; for `disable_user` a
  different target requires the requester to be an org-level contact with an
  authoriser role); checks the readiness flag, site reach for both contacts,
  policy, the attempt cap (an atomic `INSERT … WHERE (SELECT count(*) …) <
  cap` under a per-contact advisory lock), the fence, method availability and
  capability; computes the tier; generates `match_value`, two distinct
  decoys, `reverse_code`, and for links a 32-byte token whose hash is stored;
  inserts the row **and** for workstation the `device_commands` row in one
  transaction; writes `caller_verification.started` to the audit log and, when
  started from a ticket, a `system` ticket comment plus ticket event (payload
  carries `verificationId`) and outbox row. Delivery starts **after commit**,
  outside the request context. `require_ticket` is enforced here: the ticket
  must belong to the org and its `requesterContactId` must be the contact.
- `deliverers/workstation.ts` — sends the pre-created command through
  `dispatchCommandToAgent` with `{verificationId, username, technicianName,
  orgName, actionLabel, targetLabel, reverseCode, choices:[..3 shuffled..],
  timeoutMs}`. Partner trust: `caller_verify` is added to the capability
  allowlist in `services/partnerTrust.ts` next to `notify_user`.
- `commandResultHandlers.ts` gains `caller_verify`: one handler for both
  transports; looks the row up by `agent_command_id`, applies an
  expiry-aware CAS `UPDATE … WHERE status='pending' AND expires_at > now()`,
  maps `delivered=false`/`no_session_for_user` → `undeliverable`,
  `helper_outdated` → `undeliverable`, timeout → `expired`, chosen ==
  `match_value` → `verified` (tier finalised 3 or 2 from the reported
  principal), decoy → `wrong_choice`, "not me" → `rejected_by_user`.
  `not_me` is honoured from **any** state and any transport (`expired` or
  `wrong_choice` → `rejected_by_user` is a legal transition for `not_me`
  only), because a late "that is not me" is still the most valuable signal
  the system receives; the CAS above applies to number choices only.
  `caller_verify` is also added to the HTTP result route's handler registry
  allowlist (`routes/agents/commands.ts` ~L747), which is separate from the WS
  dispatch. A reconciliation job (a) expires pending rows past `expires_at`
  whose command never terminalised, (b) re-applies the handler to pending
  rows whose `device_commands` row is already terminal (the handler ran and
  crashed before the CAS), and (c) scans terminal `caller_verify` commands of
  **any** verification status whose result is `not_me` and whose row is not
  `rejected_by_user`, and applies the rejection, so a late "not me" is never
  lost between transports.
- `deliverers/link.ts` — builds `https://<partner app url>/verify/<token>`;
  SMS via `TwilioService.sendSmsMessage`, email via the branded layout. Send
  failure → `undeliverable`.
- `subjects.ts` — `resolveSubject({orgId, entraTenantId, entraOid})` → exactly
  one non-revoked binding or a typed refusal (`subject_unmatched`,
  `subject_ambiguous`). `bindingsForContact`, `attestBinding`,
  `observeLogin`.
- `destinations.ts` — `recordDestinationChange`, `currentDestination`,
  `isEstablished`, `attestDestination`.
- `gate.ts` — `requireCallerVerification({ orgId, action, target:
  {entraTenantId, entraOid}, backendTenantId, technicianUserId, intentId,
  mode: 'check' | 'consume' })`. Order: readiness flag → effective policy
  tier (`0` → pass) → `backendTenantId === target.entraTenantId` else
  `tenant_mismatch` → resolve the target binding (`subject_unmatched`,
  `subject_ambiguous`) → fence on the target **and** on the grant's
  requester (`contact_fenced`) → candidate grant: newest `verified` or
  `administrative_stepup`, unconsumed or consumed by this intent,
  `target_binding_id` = the resolved binding and snapshot tenant/OID still
  equal, recomputed `tier >= required`, `decided_at > now() - ttl`,
  `action_scope IN (action, 'any')` (administrative rows only for
  `disable_user`), `initiated_by_user_id = technicianUserId` unless
  `allow_cross_technician_use`; then per method: challenge rows → D15
  requester rule re-checked against the requester binding's current roles
  and site, and not (`method='email'` and destination in the target's mailbox
  set); `administrative_stepup` rows → `allow_administrative_disable`, the
  technician still holds `ORGS_WRITE` on the org, `stepup_session_id` is a
  live session, the user's `auth_epoch` and `mfa_epoch` equal the stored
  values, and `stepup_verified_at > now() - ttl`, else `stepup_invalidated` → in `consume` mode, CAS `consumed_at` /
  `consumed_intent_ref`. Everything from the fence read to the CAS is one
  transaction under `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the requester binding id and
  the target binding id (ascending order, one lock when equal), the same
  locks the rejection path and the dispatch marker take, so requester A's
  rejection also fences an A-authorised action on target B. Refusals are a typed
  `CallerVerificationRequiredError { orgId, contactId?, action, requiredTier,
  reason, latest? }` with reasons `no_fresh_verification`, `grant_consumed`,
  `subject_unmatched`, `subject_ambiguous`, `subject_mailboxes_unknown`,
  `tenant_mismatch`, `contact_fenced`, `requester_not_authorized`,
  `technician_mismatch`, `target_rebound`, `stepup_invalidated`,
  `administrative_disabled`. Failure semantics are D13's:
  refusal leaves the grant untouched; dispatch failure after consumption
  fails the intent and the technician sees "verification used, action failed,
  re-verify".
- `rejection.ts` — on `rejected_by_user`, in this order so the fence is
  visible before anything else runs: set the **fence** first (same
  transaction as the public CAS), then insert `incidents` (p2,
  `sourceType='caller_verification'`, `sourceRef=id`); the fence
  (the `rejected_by_user` row is the fence state until `decided_at +
  cooling_off_hours`; an override writes `fence_override_until` on that row
  plus an audit event, so the state lives in one table); mark other
  `verified`-unconsumed rows for the contact `revoked`; call
  `revokeIntentsForSubject(subject)` — a new **system-scoped** function in
  `actionIntents` that cancels `pending_approval`/`approved` intents whose
  pinned target or requester matches, with actor `system:caller_verification`
  and the verification id in details, and returns the ids of intents already
  `executing`. `executing` means "past claim", not "past dispatch": the rejection
  transaction takes the advisory locks on the rejecting contact's binding and
  on every target binding of its outstanding grants, so any such intent that has
  not yet set `dispatch_started_at` will meet the fence at its gate check and
  fail `contact_fenced`; those that have set it are listed in the incident as
  "dispatched before rejection; confirm in Entra whether the change landed",
  and the intent's own terminal state (failed with `contact_fenced`, or
  completed) is linked from the incident when it arrives;
  audit `caller_verification.rejected`; ticket comment; in-app and email
  notification to the org's security recipients **and** the partner's. All
  side effects are idempotent on the verification id (outbox rows keyed on it)
  so a retried handler does not double-open incidents.
- During the fence the gate refuses and `start` requires `ORGS_WRITE` + MFA
  on the org to override, which writes `fence_override_until` and is audited.
- `wrong_choice` is audited and shown; no incident. It counts toward
  `max_attempts_per_hour`, so three misreads lock the contact for the hour.

Rate limits (Redis `rateLimiter`): 10 starts per technician per 10 minutes
plus the per-contact attempt cap above. Public route: 30 requests per IP per
minute and the Quick Support two-tier miss budget
(`services/supportCodeMissBudget.ts`) for unknown tokens.

## Agent and helper change (workstation tier)

New device command `caller_verify`, handled in `agent/internal/heartbeat/`
beside `consent_gate.go`. It resolves the Windows session (or macOS/Linux
login session) owned by the explicit `username` through the session broker
(never `PreferredSessionWithScope`), requires it to be the **console**
session, then selects the helper the way `consentUISessionForTarget` does:
the Tauri **assist** helper with scope `consent_ui` **in that session** that
also advertises `callerVerify` (D17). It never uses `SessionForUser`, which
prefers the native `user`-role helper, and never uses the native fallback
scope. It sends IPC `caller_verify_request` with the same
correlation and timeout pattern as `consent_request`, and returns
`{delivered, choice, principal: {sid|uid, username, upn?}, helperVersion}` in
the command result's stdout JSON. `upn` comes from the session's Entra join
state where available (Windows `whoami /upn` equivalent through the token,
macOS Platform SSO attribute when present); absent is fine and caps at tier 2.
Absent session → `no_session_for_user`; non-console session →
`session_not_console`; helper without the capability → `helper_outdated`.
Timeout → `timeout`, never a choice.

Helper (`apps/helper/src-tauri/src/ipc/`): `Capabilities` gains
`callerVerify: true`; a `CallerVerifyWindow` beside `ConsentDialog.tsx`:
always on top, partner logo and name, "<technician> from <org> is on the
phone with you and wants to <action> for <target>", the reverse code in large
type, three number buttons, "This is not me", a countdown, and the line "Only
tap a number if you are on the phone with <technician> right now. If you are
not sure, hang up and call <MSP> on the number you already have."

Commands doc `apps/docs/src/content/docs/agents/commands.mdx` gains the entry.
This wave ships in an agent release, so the workstation tier is unavailable
to a fleet until it has promoted; the methods endpoint reports it as
`unavailable(helper_outdated)` per device until then.

## Gate wiring

1. `services/actionIntents/revalidateRelease.ts`: for tool names
   `m365_reset_password` and `m365_disable_user`, call the gate in `consume`
   mode with the intent's org, pinned `(entraTenantId, entraOid)`, the
   backend connection's tenant, the requesting technician and the intent id.
   This runs **after** the `executing` claim on both release paths (D13);
   the function's own transaction holds the fence read and the consume CAS.
   A refusal is a new `errorCode` `caller_verification_required` in the same
   shape as the existing failures and fails the intent.
2. `services/actionIntents/intentService.ts` `createActionIntent`: resolves
   the target to `(entraTenantId, entraOid)` through the selected backend and
   stores it on the intent (`targetEntraTenantId`, `targetEntraOid`,
   `targetConnectionRef`); runs the gate in `check` mode for UX, so the
   technician sees "Start verification" before waiting on approval. Not
   authoritative.
3. Defense in depth at dispatch, all three backends, immediately before the
   outbound call: `m365DirectGraph.invokeDirect` cases `disable_user` and
   `reset_user_password`; `writeActionService.executeM365WriteActionByOrg`
   actions `m365.user.disable` and `m365.user.reset_password`, which also
   passes the pinned OID to the executor instead of the original identifier
   (executor change in `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor`); and
   `aiToolsM365.call()` before `invokeDelegantTool` for the same two tools.
   Each re-runs the gate in `check` mode requiring `consumed_intent_ref =
   this intent`, unexpired, target unfenced, connection tenant = pinned
   tenant, OID = grant's target binding. This layer also refuses any path
   that reaches a backend without an intent (no intent → no consumed grant).
4. Contract test `callerVerificationGate.contract.test.ts` reads the four
   source files and fails if any named case no longer references the gate;
   **plus** a behavioural suite that stubs each backend's HTTP/broker client
   and asserts zero mutation calls when the gate refuses.

The AI tool layer catches the typed refusal and returns a structured error with
`requiresCallerVerification: {contactId, requiredTier, reason}` so the chat
renders the modal, not prose. Every adapter between the gate and the client is
named in the plan and tested to preserve the payload: the inline release in
`aiAgentSdk.ts` (which today reduces revalidation failures to a generic
string, ~L1455), the release worker's terminal failure, the MCP tool result,
and the helper chat route. The intent release worker treats it as a terminal,
non-retryable release failure carrying the same payload.

### Administrative disable (D15)

Interactive only. The technician (holding `ORGS_WRITE` on the org) picks the
target account and enters a reason (min 20 chars); the UI calls
`POST /auth/mfa/step-up` for operation `caller_verification_administrative_disable`
with resource digest `sha256(orgId | entraTenantId | entraOid | sha256(reason))`,
the user proves an existing factor, and the resulting `stepUpGrantId` is
presented to `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/administrative`, which
consumes the grant (`consumeStepUpGrant`, single-use, session- and
epoch-bound) and writes the `administrative_stepup` verification row. The
row is then an ordinary grant: `action_scope='disable_user'`, tier 3, bound
to that technician and target, TTL from policy, consumed once at release.
Audit `caller_verification.administrative_created` carries the reason; the
incident-response UI shows it on the contact; the partner's security
recipients are notified. The intent still goes through approval as today.
There is no non-interactive path and nothing in the release actor context
is trusted for this.

## API

All authenticated routes: readiness flag (404 when off), org scope, **site
reach for the contact** via the same helper the contact routes use
(`routes/orgContacts.ts`, "Site-axis reach"), `ORGS_READ` to view and
`ORGS_WRITE` + MFA to start, cancel, attest, bind or override, matching the
contact routes' ruling. Device and ticket ids supplied by the client are
re-checked for org ownership and the caller's site reach.

| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications` | `{ contactId, method, actionScope, targetContactId?, deviceId?, username?, ticketId?, note? }` → 202 with the row. `targetContactId` defaults to `contactId`; a different target is only accepted for `disable_user` under the D15 rule, checked here and again at release. `matchValue`, `decoyValues` and `reverseCode` are returned only to the initiating technician (creator check on every read); others see status. `ticketId` is validated (org, requester = contact) and stored as `ticket_ref`/`ticket_number`. |
| `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/administrative` | `{ targetContactId, reason, stepUpGrantId }` → 201 `administrative_stepup` row (D15) with no requester binding; copies session id, MFA epoch and verified-at from the consumed grant. `ORGS_WRITE`; refused when the effective policy has `allow_administrative_disable=false`. |
| `GET /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/:id` | polled every 2 s while pending. |
| `POST /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/:id/cancel` | pending → cancelled; initiator or `ORGS_WRITE`. |
| `GET /orgs/:orgId/contacts/:contactId/caller-verifications` | history, newest first, 50 max; includes `fencedUntil`, bindings and destinations with establishment state. |
| `GET /orgs/:orgId/contacts/:contactId/caller-verifications/methods` | per-method availability and computed tier with reasons; feeds the modal. |
| `POST /orgs/:orgId/contacts/:contactId/caller-verification-bindings` / `DELETE …/:bindingId` | technician attestation of an Entra binding (D11). |
| `POST /orgs/:orgId/contacts/:contactId/caller-verification-destinations/:id/attest` | attest a destination (D12). |
| `GET /orgs/:orgId/tickets/:ticketId/caller-verification` | freshest row with `ticket_ref = ticketId`, else freshest for the requester contact, plus `isFresh` and `isConsumed`; feeds the badge. |
| `GET /orgs/:orgId/caller-verifications/device-suggestions?contactId=` | online devices whose `last_user` or a binding's `os_username` matches the contact, with the matched username pre-filled and whether a binding exists (tier 3 vs 2). |
| `GET/PUT /orgs/:orgId/caller-verification-policy`, `GET/PUT /partner/caller-verification-policy` | `GET` returns own row + effective policy with per-field provenance; `PUT` upserts. |
| `GET /verify/:token` (public) | JSON for the card: branding, technician label, contact first name, action and target label, reverse code, the three candidates in stored order, expiry. Unknown, spent or expired → one generic "expired" response. `Cache-Control: no-store, private`. |
| `POST /verify/:token` (public) | `{ choice: '<2 digits>' \| 'not_me' }`. A number choice is one atomic `UPDATE … WHERE status='pending' AND expires_at > now()` CAS. `not_me` is accepted for any resolvable token whose row is not already `rejected_by_user` (expired, wrong-choice or verified rows included, within 24 h of creation) and runs `rejection.ts` through the outbox; the response is the same generic body either way. |

Public handlers wrap only the token lookup and the CAS in
`withSystemDbAccessContext` and get a live-DB integration test. Page rendering
is an Astro page in `apps/web` at `/verify/[token]` calling the JSON route,
consistent with the Quick Support landing page.

## Web UI

- **Entry points** (hidden while the flag is off): "Verify caller" on the
  ticket header, on contact rows and the contact drawer, and on the device
  page header (pre-selects workstation and that device; the technician picks
  the contact and confirms the username; the card shows "tier 3" only when a
  binding exists).
- **Modal**: step 0, what for: reset password / disable user / general; step
  1, method cards with computed tier and greyed reasons; step 2, match number
  and reverse code in very large type with the script line: "I've sent a
  prompt to your screen. It shows the code 7 3 1 9 and says I'm asking to
  reset your password. If that's right, tap **42**. If anything on it looks
  wrong, tap 'This is not me'." Live status; `verified` green with "usable
  once for <action> by you, expires in 30 min"; `wrong_choice` retry with the
  remaining attempts; `rejected_by_user` red panel linking to the incident;
  `undeliverable` with the concrete reason (no session for that user, helper
  outdated, not the console session, SMS failed).
- **Ticket badge**: "Caller verified · SMS · 12 min ago · unused" while fresh,
  "used for password reset" once consumed, grey "expired" after. Timeline
  shows system comments.
- **Contact drawer**: history, fence state, Entra binding (bind/unbind),
  destinations with established/attest controls.
- **Settings**: policy form under partner settings and under org settings;
  org form shows effective values with "from partner policy" and disables
  fields the org cannot loosen; persistent warning on the partner form when
  any tier is 0.
- **AI chat**: a refusal with `requiresCallerVerification` renders the modal
  inline.
- All new strings through i18n with real translations in every shipped locale.

## Threats this still does not stop

1. **Compromised endpoint or phone.** If the attacker already has the user's
   desktop session or SIM, tiers 2 and 3 pass. This is the ceiling for every
   product in the space.
2. **Coached real user (relay).** The attacker keeps the real user on a
   parallel call and repeats the match number they heard from the technician.
   Number matching does not stop this; the card mitigates by naming the
   technician, the action and the target and by telling the user to hang up
   and call the MSP back on a known number if unsure. Tier 3 with a binding
   raises the bar only in that the prompt lands on the bound user's own
   session, which the coached user is sitting at anyway.
3. **Slow-burn contact planting.** An attacker who plants a contact and waits
   out `destination_min_age_days` gets tier 2 only if a technician set or
   attested the destination; imported and inbound values never establish on
   their own. Partners with a stricter posture set `require_attested_destination`
   or the required tier to 3.
4. **Out-of-band execution.** See non-goals.
5. **Policy weakening.** Partner-row only, audited, warned in the UI.
6. **Technician collusion or a compromised technician account.** The
   technician who verifies is the one who releases; a compromised technician
   can verify a planted contact and act. Approval flow and MFA on the
   technician side are the existing controls; this feature does not add to
   them.

## Testing

- Unit: state machine transitions including `revoked` and consumption; decoy
  distinctness; token hashing; tier computation including bindings,
  establishment and the same-mailbox set; gate resolution order and every
  refusal reason; baseline-then-tighten policy resolution incl. ignored fields; deliverer result mapping
  for both transports and the duplicate-result case; rejection fan-out
  (incident, system revocation returning executing ids, fence, notifications,
  idempotency on retry); destination-change helper called from every writer
  (grep contract).
- Contract: gate references in the four files; RLS coverage (all four
  tables); org cascade; export policy; dual-axis select branch for the policy
  table; partner-wide XOR; merge registry classification; no `device_id` /
  `ticket_id` column on the new tables.
- Behavioural: each of the three backends issues zero mutation calls when the
  gate refuses, and exactly one when it passes; OID pinned through to the
  executor payload; UPN change between verification and release does not
  redirect the mutation; a connection re-pointed at another tenant refuses
  `tenant_mismatch`; a Delegant-only org and an org with two `m365_connections`
  profiles both resolve the same binding; manager-to-other-user disable
  succeeds under the authoriser rule and a substituted target OID is denied;
  a site-level primary contact cannot authorise a disable; the administrative
  route rejects a step-up grant minted for another operation, another target
  digest or another session; the release actor context's synthesised `mfa`
  never reaches the gate; an administrative row passes the gate end to end
  under default policy and fails `stepup_invalidated` after the technician's
  MFA epoch bumps or the session is revoked; a late `not_me` after expiry
  still fences and opens an incident; a rejection racing a release: before
  `dispatch_started_at` the intent fails `contact_fenced`, after it the
  incident lists it as dispatched; consumption after the `executing` claim: refusal
  leaves the grant unconsumed, dispatch failure leaves it consumed and fails
  the intent, same-intent retry passes; a CSV import carrying an `entra`
  external id creates no binding.
- Integration (live DB): cross-org forge → 42501 on all four tables; sibling-
  site user denied on every authenticated route; public route under system
  context; concurrent `POST /verify/:token` CAS; concurrent release of two
  intents against one grant → exactly one consumes; forged
  `requester_binding_id` / `target_binding_id` / `destination_id`
  pointing at another org's row → 23503 even under system context, and a
  same-org binding of a different contact → 23503; org merge with a pending
  verification, two populated policies, fresh grants in the loser org
  (revoked), a **consumed** grant whose intent stays in the loser org (row
  repoints, `consumed_at` intact), and the same OID or `os_principal` bound in
  both orgs (both revoked, conflict audited, merge completes); deleting a
  contact cascades verifications, bindings and destinations in one statement
  with the column-specific SET NULL leaving `org_id`/`contact_id` intact; deleting target contact B while requester A holds a grant on B succeeds and A's grant becomes `target_rebound`; device org-move leaves
  `workstation_device_ref` rows untouched
  and does not trip the composite FK; intent release refused without a fresh
  verification and allowed with one; "not me" during `executing` reports the
  intent as dispatched.
- Agent: `go test -race` for `caller_verify` session targeting (explicit
  username, missing session, non-console session, helper without capability,
  timeout is not approval, principal reported, **native `user` helper and
  Tauri `assist` helper both connected in the target session → the Tauri one
  is chosen**, native-only session → `helper_outdated`). Helper: capability advertised;
  window renders action, target, three buttons and reports the choice; an old
  helper build ignores the message and the agent times out to
  `helper_outdated`, tested with a stub helper that lacks the capability.
- Web: modal availability and tier display, badge freshness and consumption,
  policy forms with read-only provenance, locale parity, all hidden when the
  flag is off.
- Manual, pre-release, on the lab rigs: workstation prompt on Windows 11
  (Entra-joined, tier 3) and macOS (tier 2); SMS to a real handset; "not me"
  ends in an incident, fences the contact and cancels a pending intent; a
  UPN-renamed user is still the pinned OID.

## Waves

| Wave | Scope |
|---|---|
| W01 | All four tables, migrations, registrations (RLS, cascade, export, merge), destination-change helper wired into every contact writer with backfill, subject bindings from the Graph-backed directory sync only, policy resolver (partner baseline, org tighten-only) and defaults, service state machine, tier and establishment rules, gate service with consumption, `revokeIntentsForSubject`, authenticated API with site reach, callback attestation method, audit and ticket timeline. Readiness flag off. |
| W02 | Agent `caller_verify` command with principal reporting, helper capability + window, shared command-result handler, pre-created command row, workstation deliverer, device suggestions, partner-trust allowlist, commands doc. Needs an agent release. |
| W03 | SMS and email deliverers, public JSON route, Astro challenge page, rate limits and miss budget, `m365.user.mailboxes` read action on all three backends for the same-mailbox rule. |
| W04 | Web: modal (requester + target selection), entry points, ticket badge, contact drawer (bindings, destinations, fence), policy forms with provenance and ignored-field reporting, administrative disable flow with step-up, AI chat refusal rendering, i18n. All behind the flag. |
| W05 | Tenant+OID pinning in intents and executor; gate wired into `revalidateRelease` (consume mode, post-claim), intent-creation check, all three backends at dispatch, administrative route + step-up operation, contract + behavioural tests; rejection fan-out (fence, incident, revocation, partner notification); every refusal adapter; docs and release notes; **flag flipped on**. Lands last so W01–W04 change no existing M365 flow and expose nothing. |

Feature-lifecycle registration happens when the plans are written.

## Review notes

### Independent Claude reviewer, 2026-09-18 (v1)

- R1 Workstation tier cannot be built on `notify_user`. Adopted: D3.
- R2 Two disjoint Graph executors; the shared fail-closed seam is
  `revalidateRelease.ts`. Adopted: D5 (widened to three backends in v2).
- R3 No org-scoped config-policy resolver exists. Adopted: D6.
- R4 `device_id + ticket_id + org_id` would be the first dual-axis org-move
  child. Adopted: D7 (tightened in v2 to rename the columns).
- R5 `alerts.device_id` is NOT NULL. Adopted: incidents, D8.
- R6 Inbound email auto-creates contacts; email-to-mailbox before resetting
  that mailbox is circular; no attempt cap. Adopted: establishment rule,
  same-mailbox exclusion, attempt cap, cooling-off.
- R7 Always target an explicit username. Adopted.
- R8 Emit ticket event and outbox row with the system comment. Adopted.
- R9 `sendCommandToAgentAwaitResult` is api-role-affine. Adopted: D9.

### Codex gpt-6-astra `xhigh`, second pass on v2, 2026-09-19 (v3) — verdict "rework", all folded

Full text: `2026-09-18-caller-verification-design.codex-review-v2.md`. Nine of
the original eighteen were "partially resolved" and nine new majors were
raised; every one maps to a v3 change:

| # | Finding | Adopted as |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Unbound workstation still met the default gate at tier 2 | D4: unbound workstation is tier 1 |
| P2 | Importer accepts uploaded ids; Graph projection lacks `proxyAddresses` | D11: only the Graph-backed sync writes bindings; W03 `m365.user.mailboxes` read action |
| P3 | Connection id survives a tenant change | D11/D14: tenant pinned, checked at dispatch |
| P5/N5 | Consume cannot share the release CAS transaction | D13: post-claim consumption with explicit failure semantics |
| P7 | Fence unsynchronised with dispatch; `executing` ≠ dispatched | fence set first in the rejection tx, read inside the consume tx and again at dispatch; incident wording |
| P9 | HTTP handler registry allowlist; crashed-handler recovery | `commands.ts` allowlist + reconciliation over terminal commands |
| P11 | Frozen tier ignores later policy tightening | D4: tier recomputed at release |
| P14/N9 | Per-org unique on principals breaks plain `repoint` | D18: bindings are `custom` with collision revocation before the move |
| P16/N1 | Requester and target conflated | D13/D15: `requester_binding_id` + `target_binding_id`, card names the target |
| P18 | `XOR_OWNERSHIP_DUAL_AXIS_TABLES` omitted | registration checklist |
| N2 | Release context synthesises `mfa: true`; no freshness | D15: interactive MFA step-up grant → durable `administrative_stepup` row; nothing trusted from the release actor |
| N3 | Plain uuid FKs allow cross-org references | composite FKs carrying `org_id` (+ `contact_id`) on all three references |
| N4 | One connection FK cannot serve three backends | D11: identity is tenant+OID, no connection FK |
| N6 | Strictest-wins over defaults blocked partner loosening | D6: partner baseline, then org tighten-only, operators per field |
| N7 | `is_primary` is org **or site** headline | D15: org-level contacts with explicit roles only (default role corrected to `admin` in v4) |
| N8 | `SessionForUser` prefers the native helper | D17: mirror `consentUISessionForTarget`, Tauri assist helper in the target's console session |

### Codex gpt-6-astra `xhigh`, third pass on v3, 2026-09-19 (v4) — 15/19 resolved, verdict "rework", all folded

Full text: `2026-09-18-caller-verification-design.codex-review-v3.md`.

| # | Finding | Adopted as |
|---|---|---|
| P7 | Fence reads not serialised against dispatch | D13: `dispatch_started_at` marker + per-target advisory lock shared by gate, rejection and dispatch |
| P9 | Late `not_me` blocked by the expiry CAS | handler: `not_me` honoured from any state |
| P16/N10 | Administrative rows cannot pass the common gate (`allowed_methods`, null requester) | D15: administrative variant exempt from `allowed_methods`, governed by `allow_administrative_disable`, own gate branch, requester CHECK relaxed for that method |
| N2 | Durable admin row discards step-up session/epoch bindings | `stepup_session_id` / `stepup_mfa_epoch` / `stepup_verified_at` columns re-checked at release |
| N11 | `(intent, org)` FK breaks repoint because intents stay with the loser org | `consumed_intent_ref` snapshot, no FK; `consumed_at` is the marker |
| N12 | New composite FKs not deferrable; `SET NULL` clears owner columns / violates CHECK | all three `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, `ON DELETE NO ACTION`, rely on contact cascade |
| N13 | `it_admin` is not in `CONTACT_ROLES` | default authoriser role `admin` |

### Codex gpt-6-astra `xhigh`, fourth pass on v4, 2026-09-19 (v5) — 3/7 resolved, 4 partial, **no new blockers**

Full text: `2026-09-18-caller-verification-design.codex-review-v4.md`.

| # | Residual | Adopted as |
|---|---|---|
| P7 | Target-only lock misses requester A's rejection vs A-authorised action on B | advisory locks on both requester and target binding ids, ordered |
| P9 | Reconciliation pending-only; public POST required pending | reconciliation (c) for late `not_me`; public `not_me` accepted from any non-rejected state |
| N2 | `authEpoch` omitted; grant has no proof timestamp | `stepup_auth_epoch` added; `stepup_verified_at` set at the route within grant TTL; admin freshness aged from it |
| N12 | Requester FK delete action contradictory; target delete blocked by history rows | column-specific `SET NULL` on all three, service-enforced non-null at creation, null → unusable grant |

## Open questions for Todd

None blocking. Defaults chosen: gate tier 2, TTL 30 minutes, establishment
window 7 days, backfilled destinations unestablished until attested, 3
attempts per hour, 24 hour fence, ticket not required, single technician use,
administrative disable allowed, authoriser role `admin` (existing
`CONTACT_ROLES` value; partners edit the list).
All are policy knobs. Two product calls worth a glance:

1. The backfill rule means every existing contact starts at tier 1 for
   SMS/email until a technician attests the number, which is the safe default
   but adds a one-time attestation chore per partner.
2. An unbound workstation prompt is tier 1, so for a contact with no Entra
   binding (no M365 sync for that org) the only tier-2 routes are an
   attested SMS/email destination. That is deliberate: without a binding the
   product cannot say whose screen the prompt landed on.
