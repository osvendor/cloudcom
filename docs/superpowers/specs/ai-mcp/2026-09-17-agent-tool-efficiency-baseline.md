# Agent Tool Efficiency — A-W01 Baseline

**Date measured:** 2026-09-19 · **Branch:** `feature/6147-agent-tool-efficiency/wave-6148` @ `70116bb709` · **Plan:** `2026-09-17-agent-tool-efficiency-a01-baseline-harness.md` Task 9

All measurements below were produced locally against the real Anthropic API (no dev stack, no prod DB). Every cell is either a measured number with the source line/file, or `not run: <reason>`.

## 1. What was measured and how

- **Harness:** `pnpm --filter @breeze/api ai:tool-capture` (`apps/api/src/services/llm/__scripts__/tool-capture.ts`) drives `runSurfaceCapture` (`toolCapture/runSurface.ts`), which calls `query()` from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` with each surface's real `allowedTools`/`onlyTools` from `CAPTURE_SURFACES` (`toolCapture/surfaces.ts`).
- **Deny mode:** every `createBreezeMcpServer`/`createScriptBuilderMcpServer` handler is wrapped in `onPreToolUse: denyPreToolUse`, which refuses at the handler level *before* `getAuth()` or any DB access runs (`runSurface.ts:11-27`). This means every capture is safe to run with no seeded org/device data and no live DB — a tool call is attempted, observed, and denied; no side effects. `DATABASE_URL` is only required because module-load-time registry imports touch `../../../db`; it is never queried in deny mode. A `result` message with a non-`success` subtype (e.g. `error_max_turns`, because every tool attempt is refused) is expected, not a harness failure.
- **`--proxy`:** starts a local HTTP proxy (`toolCapture/captureProxy.ts`) in front of `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and records `tools[]` length, `defer_loading` per tool, `system` field byte length, and usage from each `/v1/messages` request. **Trap found while running this task:** the proxy also captures the CLI's own `/api/hello` handshake and a small Haiku `/v1/messages` call the CLI issues first (title/summary generation) — both have `tools: []`. The script's console-table renderer picks `proxyRequests[0]`, which is one of these non-tool-call requests, so the printed "tools sent"/"deferred" columns show `0`/`null` even when the real Sonnet call carried tools. This is a **display-only** bug in the console summary; the JSONL itself has the full `proxyRequests` array with every request in order, so this doc's numbers below were read directly from the JSONL (the correct Sonnet `/v1/messages` record — 3rd request in each turn's window), not from the printed table. Not fixed in code this run: it does not affect what is measured, only what the ad hoc CLI table prints, and the plan's Task 9 scope is measurement + doc, not harness hardening. Flagging as a known follow-up for A-W02+ (`runSurfaceCapture`'s consumer should filter `proxyRequests` to `model !== null && tools.length > 0` rather than index `[0]`).
- **`--tool-search on|off`:** sets `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true|false` in the child env before spawning the CLI subprocess; **required** with `--proxy` because the local proxy is not a first-party Anthropic host and the SDK silently disables tool search's default-on behavior against a non-default base URL (`tool-capture.ts` `UsageError` guard).
- **SDK / CLI:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.277` (installed, `apps/api/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/package.json`).
- **Model:** `resolveDefaultModel()` resolved to `claude-sonnet-4-6` for all captures and the eval; the CLI additionally issues one `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` call per turn for its own title/summary purpose (see proxy trap above) — this is CLI overhead, not something Breeze's code requests.
- **`AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE` bytes:** `Buffer.byteLength(AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE)` = **12265 bytes** (captured field `systemPromptBytes` in every JSONL row; also printed by `ai:tool-eval`'s summary line). The wire `system` field (JSON-stringified, as sent to the API) is 12640 bytes (proxy `systemBytes` field) — the delta is JSON string-escaping overhead, not extra content.
- **Raw output:** `tool-capture.jsonl` (7 rows: chat×2 proxy modes, helper-standard, helper-basic, agent-full, script-builder ×1 turn each) and `tool-eval-report.json` / `tool-eval-summary.md` (60/60 golden cases, chat surface, default tool search), all under the run's scratchpad `measure/` directory (not committed — JSONL/report files are run artifacts, not source).
- **Not run this session:** BYO `--base-url` endpoint (no BYO catalog credentials available in this environment — Todd owns those), `--turns 2` for every surface (only `chat` was run at 2 turns per the plan's cache-read-share ask; the other surfaces were run at `--turns 1` per this task's instructions), prod hot/cold SQL (needs Todd's DB access, see §4), `curl` against a live dev stack's external MCP `tools/list` (no stack running — see §6).
- **Env-gating caveat:** every tool count in this doc (117 for the full chat/agent-full registry) was measured with `M365_ENABLED`, `DELEGANT_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_ENABLED`, and `BREEZE_AI_SCRIPT_AUTHORING_ENABLED` all unset. 117 is the **floor** for a default install, not a ceiling: a fully configured chat surface registers roughly 34 more tools (25 `google_*`, 5 `m365_*`, and the script proposal tools), since `buildBreezeSdkTools` (`aiAgentSdkTools.ts`) conditionally spreads in `googleToolDefinitions`/`aiToolsM365`/`scriptProposalToolDefinitions` at call time — none of which are static `TOOL_TIERS` entries. `runSurfaceCapture` (`toolCapture/runSurface.ts`) now derives `registeredToolCount`/`registeredToolNames` from `buildBreezeSdkTools(...).filter(onlyTools)` under the harness's actual env, not from `Object.keys(TOOL_TIERS).length`, so a future capture run against a fully configured environment will show the higher number automatically.

## 2. Tool search: on or off today?

| Surface | `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` | ToolSearch seen | Tools sent (proxy) | Deferred (proxy) | Turn-1 `input_tokens` | `cache_creation` | `cache_read` | Turn-2 `cache_read` share | TTFT ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| chat | on (forced by proxy) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | 117 | 0 | 4 | 55971 | 55842 | not run: only 1 turn captured with `--tool-search on/off` (2-turn capture was run without `--tool-search`/`--proxy`, see row below) | 2535 |
| chat | off (forced by proxy) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | 117 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 111813 | see above | 1480 |
| chat (default, no proxy, 2 turns — cited from task brief, not re-run this session) | unset (SDK default) | reported: not seen | not run: no `--proxy` on this citation | — | 4 | 10241 | 101618 | turn 2: input=3, cache_create=177, cache_read=56012 → **56012 / (3+177+56012) = 99.7%** | 2667 |
| helper-standard | unset (SDK default) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | not run: no `--proxy` | — | 4 | 10266 | 101640 | not run (1 turn) | 1673 |
| helper-basic | unset (SDK default) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | not run: no `--proxy` | — | 4 | 0 | 111906 | not run (1 turn) | 1476 |
| agent-full | unset (SDK default) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | not run: no `--proxy` | — | 4 | 157 | 111738 | not run (1 turn) | null (agent-full has `includePartialMessages: false`, so no streaming TTFT is observable) |
| script-builder | unset (SDK default) | uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0 | not run: no `--proxy` | — | 3 | 12804 | 0 | not run (1 turn); no tool call this turn (`first tool: null`) | 1201 |
| `byo:<host>` | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | not run: no BYO catalog endpoint/credentials available this session |

This session's own `chat`/`--tool-search on` proxy run shows different cache numbers (`cache_create=55971 cache_read=55842`) than the task brief's earlier, un-proxied 2-turn run (`cache_create=10241 cache_read=101618`) for the same "turn 1" label — Anthropic's prompt cache is a live, shared, TTL'd resource, not a harness constant, and the earlier run's higher cache-read number likely reflects a warmer cache from prior activity against the same account. Compare shape (input tokens near-zero, cache dominating) rather than exact digits across runs.

**Answer to the spec's question ("is tool search already on, and where does it silently fall back or fail?"):** Tool search is **not observed as active anywhere** on the first-party path today. Across every surface and every `--tool-search` setting tested (including forcing `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` through the proxy), `ToolSearch seen` reports `uses=0, blocks=0, refs=0, stderr=0`, and the proxy shows all 117 tools sent with `defer_loading: false` on every one — even under `--tool-search on`. Breeze's registry (117 tools for the full chat/agent-full surface) sits well under whatever count triggers the SDK's automatic deferral; nothing in this codebase currently sets `searchHint`/`alwaysLoad`/per-tool `defer_loading` to opt in explicitly. So the finding is: tool search is not silently falling back on a BYO/non-default host (that path is untested — no BYO endpoint available) — it simply never engages on the default host either, because nothing asks for it. This matches the design doc's suspicion (`2026-09-17-agent-tool-efficiency-and-mcp-modernization-design.md`: "Breeze sets none of it and has never measured whether it is active") and answers it: confirmed inactive, not silently degraded.

## 3. Golden eval

Run: `pnpm --filter @breeze/api ai:tool-eval -- --out tool-eval-report.json --summary-md tool-eval-summary.md` (chat surface, default tool search, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, all 60 cases, deny mode). Completed in ~2 minutes — not a partial run.

**Overall: 19/60 = 31.7%** (`tool-eval-summary.md` header line 1; `tool-eval-report.json` `summary.hits=19, summary.total=60, summary.accuracy=0.3167`).

**Only `chat` was run** (per this task's instructions, which asked for the 60-case chat-surface default run, not the plan's full per-surface/per-mode matrix); `helper-standard` accuracy and the Haiku 4.5 row (spec open decision 2) are `not run: out of scope for this pass — see plan Task 9 §3 for the fuller matrix Todd/A-W04 should run`.

**The task brief's "21 golden-case expected tools are registered but undeclared for chat" is a one-off from the actual count: it is 21 *exception-list entries* (`PENDING_DECLARATION` = `search_documentation`, 1 tool — A-W02 Task 5 will declare it; `BASELINE_UNDECLARED_TOOLS` = 20 pre-existing #3300 gaps: `browse_snapshots`, `get_backup_status`, `get_compliance_status`, `get_executive_summary`, `get_ip_history`, `get_network_changes`, `get_peripheral_activity`, `get_sensitive_data_overview`, `get_sla_breaches`, `get_sla_compliance_report`, `get_software_compliance`, `list_monitors`, `manage_quotes`, `manage_tags`, `manage_tickets`, `query_agent_versions`, `query_backups`, `restore_snapshot`, `search_script_library`, `trigger_backup`, `trigger_mssql_backup`), but **22 distinct tool names actually appear in `GOLDEN_CASES[].expect[].tool`** when cross-referenced against those two sets (verified by loading `GOLDEN_CASES` directly and intersecting) — every one of the 21 exception-list entries is used by at least one golden case (as `goldenPrompts.test.ts`'s "unused exception" check requires), and no case uses more than one, so the +1 is simply that the exception list and the used-tool list are the same size (21) plus... on direct recount there are 22 because `search_documentation` (`PENDING_DECLARATION`) plus all 20 `BASELINE_UNDECLARED_TOOLS` entries are each referenced by at least one case = 21, and the 22nd is `get_sla_compliance_report`, which is referenced by g26's `expect[]` in addition to `get_sla_breaches` — i.e. 21 distinct exception-list tool names, 22 counting a golden case that names two of them. These tools (all 21) are absent from `TOOL_TIERS`, so they get no system-prompt domain-index promotion — see the reachability caveat below.

**Correction (this session):** the framing above conflated two different things — "has at least one undeclared expected tool" (20 cases) with "structurally unwinnable" (a stricter, smaller set). The right question is whether EVERY tool in a case's `expect[]` is undeclared, since a case with even one declared alternate is winnable through ordinary system-prompt promotion. Cross-referencing `GOLDEN_CASES[i].expect[].tool` against `PENDING_DECLARATION ∪ BASELINE_UNDECLARED_TOOLS` with an "every, not some" filter (frozen by `goldenPrompts.test.ts`'s "freezes the structurally-unwinnable-on-chat case set" test) gives exactly **10 structurally unwinnable cases**: `g23, g26, g34, g35, g36, g49, g55, g59, g60` (g57 became winnable once A-W02 declared `search_documentation`) — ceiling **50/60 = 83.3%** on chat until A-W02/A-W06 declares those tools. The other 10 of the original 20 (`g16, g24, g25, g27, g29, g32, g37, g51, g53, g54`) each have at least one *declared* tool among their acceptable answers and are winnable today through ordinary prompt-level promotion. In particular, `query_monitors` (g51) and `get_fleet_health` (g54) **are declared** in `TOOL_TIERS` (tiers 1 and 1 respectively, `aiAgentSdkTools.ts`) — the earlier framing that these were "undeclared tools that hit anyway, showing undeclared doesn't mean unreachable" was simply wrong; they hit because they are declared, not despite not being declared. (`get_sla_breaches`, which g26 hit on, genuinely is undeclared, but g26 is one of the 10 structurally-unwinnable cases precisely because its only other acceptable answer, `get_sla_compliance_report`, is also undeclared.)

**Accuracy excluding structurally-unwinnable cases:** filtering `tool-eval-report.json`'s 60 cases down to the 50 winnable ones (excluding `g23, g26, g34, g35, g36, g49, g55, g59, g60` (g57 became winnable once A-W02 declared `search_documentation`)) leaves **18 hits / 50 = 36.0%** (vs. 31.7% unfiltered, 19/60). This replaces the earlier 16/40 figure, which used the wrong (looser) exclusion set. This is the fairer baseline number for judging real tool-selection quality and for A-W04's "+10 points" success measure.

Note the dominant miss pattern is **not** wrong-domain confusion: the model very often calls `query_devices` or `list_organizations` as an exploratory first step (get context, then act) rather than jumping straight to the specific action tool the golden case names — e.g. g03/g05/g10/g12/g13/g14/g15/g19/g20/g21/g22/g25/g29/g45/g55/g56 all observed `query_devices` against an `expect` that starts with a more specific tool (or `resolve_device_context`). This is a real accuracy signal (deny mode means the model never gets a real device match back to justify the broader call), not a harness artifact.

### 2026-09-21 — A-W03 Task 7: re-measured baseline + after (production-prompt harness)

The numbers above (31.7%/19-60, measured 2026-09-19) predate PR #6405, which fixed the harness to send each surface's real production system prompt (`composeStaticSystemPrompt`) instead of `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE` alone. That changed what the model actually sees, so the old row is not a valid comparison point for A-W03's "accuracy did not drop" gate. Both rows below were produced with the **same**, post-#6405 harness (`ai:tool-eval`, `chat` surface, `--tool-search default`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, all 60 golden cases, deny mode, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`/`AI_TOOL_EVAL_KEY` via `.github/workflows/ai-tool-eval.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`), so they are directly comparable to each other even though they are not directly comparable to the 2026-09-19 row.

| Branch | Run | Commit | Hits/Total | Accuracy | `systemPromptBytes` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (pre-A-W03 descriptions) | [run 35633528749](https://github.com/LanternOps/breeze/actions/runs/35633528749) | `main` @ dispatch time 2026-09-21 | 18/60 | 30.0% | 11347 |
| `feature/6147-agent-tool-efficiency/wave-6150` (A-W03 description diet) | [run 35633521176](https://github.com/LanternOps/breeze/actions/runs/35633521176) | `21926244d` | 20/60 | 33.3% | 10906 |

**Gate: accuracy must not drop vs. the same-harness baseline.** 33.3% (20/60) ≥ 30.0% (18/60) → **PASS** (+2 hits). `systemPromptBytes` also dropped 441 bytes (11347 → 10906), consistent with the description diet shrinking the static prompt while the moved disambiguation prose lands in the generated tool index (included in `systemPromptBytes` on both runs, since both are measured via the same `composeStaticSystemPrompt` path).

Full miss tables for both runs are in the workflow run artifacts (`tool-eval-report.json`, `tool-eval-summary.md`; 90-day retention) linked above; not reproduced here as the per-case rows are identical in method to §3's table above and add no new information beyond the summary row.

## 4. Hot/cold (90 days, EU + US)

`not run: no production database access in this environment.` The reporting endpoint (`GET /api/v1/admin/ai/tool-usage?days=90`, `apps/api/src/routes/admin/aiToolUsage.ts`) and the operator SQL this plan calls for (`docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/sql/2026-09-17-ai-tool-usage-90d.sql`) exist in the codebase, but running either requires either a live deployed API with real `ai_tool_executions` history or Todd's direct psql access to the EU/US production databases — neither is available from this worktree/session. Top-20-by-executions, the cold list, and the Helper-vs-chat split are all `not run: <reason above>` and remain open for Todd to fill (per the plan's Step 2 instruction that a row of `not run` is acceptable, a row of invented numbers is not).

## 5. Inputs to A-W04

`not run: blocked on §4.` The plan's Task 9 makes A-W04's `alwaysLoad` set, the Helper `onlyTools` recommendation, and the BYO fallback decision each derive from the hot/cold list intersected with the context-tool set — none of which exists without §4's data. What this session can contribute instead:

- **Haiku decision (spec open decision 2):** `not run` — the plan calls for a `--model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` eval row to decide this; out of scope for this task's instructed command set (chat/default only). Left for A-W04 alongside the full per-surface/per-mode eval matrix.
- **BYO fallback decision:** `not run` — no BYO endpoint/credentials available to test whether `tool_reference` is rejected.
- Qualitative candidate for `alwaysLoad`, **not a substitute for the hot-list intersection**: `resolve_device_context` and `query_devices` are the two tools the golden eval's model reaches for as a first exploratory step across most device-scoped prompts (§3), which is suggestive but not a measured hot-list — do not treat this as the A-W04 input; it is only a hint pending §4.

## 6. Success-measure baselines (spec "Success measures" section, as measured today)

| Success measure | Baseline (today) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Web chat first-turn input tokens | **4** (`input_tokens`, turn 1, chat surface) | `tool-capture.jsonl` row 0 (`--surface chat --proxy --tool-search on`), `observation.apiCalls` reduced; also seen as 4 across every surface's turn-1 row this session |
| Cache-read share of input, turn 2+ | **99.7%** (`56012 / (3 + 177 + 56012)`), chat surface, 2-turn no-proxy capture (per the task brief's stated numbers: turn 2 input=3, cache_create=177, cache_read=56012) | Task brief's supplied first-run numbers (this session's own `--proxy` runs only went 1 turn per surface except the on/off `chat` pair, which also went 1 turn; the 2-turn number is the one already on record from the prior run referenced in this task's instructions, reproduced here as the baseline since re-running it added no new information) |
| Golden eval first-call accuracy | **31.7%** unfiltered (19/60); **36.0%** excluding the 10 structurally-unwinnable cases (18/50) | `tool-eval-summary.md` line 1; `tool-eval-report.json` `summary`; §3 above |
| System prompt bytes | **12265 bytes** (`AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE`, `Buffer.byteLength`) — well over the ≤6 KB target, and this is the *base* prompt only (before any per-request additions) | `tool-capture.jsonl` `systemPromptBytes` field (every row); `tool-eval-report.json` `systemPromptBytes`; `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts:17` |
| External `tools/list` bytes for a single-domain grant | `not run: no dev stack running this session (no docker/postgres up in this worktree) to `curl` the external MCP server (`routes/mcpServer.ts`) with a live `ai:read` key.` | — |
| Route modules without an `MCP_COVERAGE` entry | **504 of 504** (all of them) — `grep -rn "MCP_COVERAGE" apps/api/src` returns zero matches anywhere in the codebase, and `find apps/api/src/routes -name "*.ts" ! -name "*.test.ts"` counts 504 non-test route module files | ad hoc grep/find this session; the contract this measure refers to (`MCP_COVERAGE`) does not exist until A-W06 |
| Golden eval first-call accuracy (2026-09-21, A-W03 Task 7, post-#6405 harness) | `main` (same-harness baseline): **30.0%** (18/60); `wave-6150` (after description diet): **33.3%** (20/60) — gate PASS, +2 hits | Workflow runs [35633528749](https://github.com/LanternOps/breeze/actions/runs/35633528749) (main) and [35633521176](https://github.com/LanternOps/breeze/actions/runs/35633521176) (`21926244d`); §3 above |
| System prompt bytes (2026-09-21, post-#6405 production-prompt harness) | `main`: **11347 bytes**; `wave-6150`: **10906 bytes** (−441 bytes) | Same two runs, `tool-eval-report.json` `systemPromptBytes`; not comparable to the 12265-byte `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE`-only row above, which predates #6405 and measured a different (smaller) prompt surface |
