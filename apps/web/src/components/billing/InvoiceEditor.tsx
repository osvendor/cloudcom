  // prop changes" pattern) rather than from a `useEffect`, and that distinction
  // is the entire fix for #3277.
  //
  // The previous shape was:
  //   useEffect(() => { setNotes(invoice.notes ?? ''); setNotesDirty(false); }, [invoice.notes]);
  // which ALSO ran once on mount, where it is normally a redundant no-op — the
  // useState initialisers already hold the server value. But a passive effect is
  // deferred: React commits the editor, and only schedules the effect flush for a
  // later task. Anything that lands in between — a keystroke in the real app, a
  // `fireEvent.change` in a test that awaited the commit — is applied FIRST, and
  // then the stale mount effect flushes and overwrites it with the pre-edit
  // server value, silently clearing `notesDirty` with it. Because `saveNotes()`
  // short-circuits on `!notesDirty`, the following blur then dispatches NO PATCH
  // at all: the edit is discarded with no request, no error and no "unsaved" cue.
  //
  // That is what made the InvoiceWorkspace queued-Issue tests flaky, filed five
  // times from 2026-07-29 on (#2925 → #3219 → #3277 → #3980 → #4033). Under load
  // the passive-effect flush slipped past the commit that Testing Library was
  // waiting on, the PATCH was never sent, so `savePending` never went true and
  // `invoice-issue-saving-hint` never rendered — a condition that could never
  // become true, which is why both attempts to fix it by enlarging the timeout
  // budget (#3284, #3956) could not hold.
  //
  // Evaluating the same condition during render removes the window entirely:
  // there is no deferred write that can land after a local edit, and the mount
  // pass is a genuine no-op because the synced value starts equal to the server
  // value. Comparing the NORMALISED strings additionally stops a null → ''
