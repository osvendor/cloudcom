 * originating quote: invoices are edited independently after issue and need not
 * originate from a quote at all.)

 * each bundle exactly once, and every manual/catalog line is already top-level.
 * Children are excluded by parentage, not visibility — a *visible* component must
 * still not be double-counted.
 *
 * Each top-level line maps straight through (raw `quantity`/`unitPrice`/
 * `costBasis`, same as the quote mapping) so the shared cents math does a single
 * round and a null `costBasis` is counted in `linesMissingCost` (driving the
 * "estimate incomplete" warning) rather than silently booked as $0. Invoices are
 * one-time → `recurrence: 'one_time'`, so the monthly/annual nets stay 0 and
 * `MarginPanel` self-hides those rows. Billed-only (`customerVisible`) and
