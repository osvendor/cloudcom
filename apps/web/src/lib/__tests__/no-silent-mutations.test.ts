/**
 * Guard: in the targeted set, every *mutating* fetchWithAuth call site — direct
 * or reached through an imported `src/lib/api/*` wrapper — must be lexically
 * wrapped by `runAction(...)` OR carry an explicit, reasoned
 * `// runaction-exempt:` marker (for the legitimate aggregate / inline-feedback
 * handlers). Whole-file allowlist entries (typed service layers, transport
 * stores) are still skipped via RUN_ACTION_ALLOWLIST.
 *
 * This is an AST check (TypeScript compiler API), not a regex/substring scan.
 * The previous version asserted only that the *file* contained the string
 * "runAction" somewhere — so a new bare mutation added next to existing
 * runAction usage passed unconditionally, and `{ method: opts.method }` /
 * `{ method }` / parenthesised URL args were never matched at all. It had no
 * teeth for the realistic regression. This one is call-local and conservative:
 * a non-literal `method` is treated as potentially-mutating. Imported API
 * wrappers are resolved through TypeScript symbols, including aliases and
 * re-exports, instead of relying on a hand-maintained wrapper-name list.
