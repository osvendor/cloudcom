/**
 * CONTRACT TEST — every caller-facing write to partner-wide state must consult
 * `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` (epic #2135).
 *
 * Why this file exists: the security review of 2026-08-16 (§1.1) found SIX
 * independent write sites that gated on `scope` and never on the CAPABILITY —
 * custom fields, the approval-assurance floor, update rings (route + AI tool),
 * AI prompt templates, alert templates, and partner service principals (which
 * mint partner-wide MACHINE CREDENTIALS). Human code review had caught 0 of
 * them across six separate PRs. That is exactly the failure profile the cascade
 * lists and RLS coverage already answer mechanically, so this answers it the
 * same way.
 *
 * The rule, and it is deliberately blunt:
 *
 *   A file under `src/routes/**` or `src/services/**` that mutates a
 *   PARTNER-AXIS table must mention `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` or carry a
 *   documented allowlist exemption.
 *
 * The walk originally covered routes + aiTools only; it was extended to all of
 * services/ on 2026-08-23 after BOTH real instances of this bug class
 * (partnerLlmConfig.ts, partnerStripe.ts) turned out to live in services the
 * walk never saw — the mutation sits in a service, the gate in its route, and
 * the guard read neither.
 *
 * "Partner-axis table" is derived from the live Drizzle schema, never
 * hand-listed: any table with a `partner_id` column whose `org_id` is absent or
 * NULLABLE can hold a row that belongs to the partner rather than to one org —
 * i.e. a row that pushes state into every org under the MSP, including orgs
 * created later. `org_id NOT NULL` tables cannot express that and are skipped.
 *
 * Scope is limited to routes + AI tools on purpose: those are the surfaces a
 * human or an agent can reach with a token. Workers, jobs, seeds and background
 * services run in a system context with no caller to gate, and enumerating them
 * would drown the signal.
 *
 * The check is textual (does the file mention the helper?), not semantic — it
 * cannot prove the gate is placed correctly, only that the author was made to
 * think about it. Per-route tests assert the 403 actually fires. A grep-level
 * guard that fires 6/6 is worth far more than a clever one that ships.
 *
 * Adding a file here: FIRST convince yourself the write genuinely cannot create
 * or modify a partner-owned row from a caller's request. Then add it to
 * ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK with a reason. An entry with no reason is a
 * bug you have not found yet.
 *
 * Plain unit test — reads the Drizzle schema objects and the source tree. No
 * database, so it runs in the `test-api` job where a stale base still fails.
