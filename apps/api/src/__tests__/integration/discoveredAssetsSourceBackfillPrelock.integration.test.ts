/**
 * Live-Postgres regression for the v0.111.0 US outage (Refs #5239).
 *
 * `2026-10-14-100100-discovered-assets-manual-source.sql` backfills
 * `discovered_assets.source` with two set-based UPDATEs in one transaction.
 * `discovered_assets` carries `breeze_partner_export_material_update` ->
 * `breeze_partner_export_site_child_update`, which unconditionally takes
 * `breeze_partner_export_lock_orgs_exclusive()` over EVERY org in the
 * statement's transition tables — and that helper takes the orgs' partners
 * (shared) first. The lock ledger is transaction-scoped
 * (`set_config(..., is_local => true)`), so the two statements share it: the
 * second one asks for a partner lock after org locks are already held and
 * raises P0001.
 *
 * This is not reproducible without a real database and real multi-tenant rows:
 * the whole failure lives in plpgsql trigger bodies and transaction-local
 * GUCs, and it needs `discovered_assets` rows spread over at least two
 * PARTNERS. CI's database has none, which is precisely why the bug shipped.
 *
 * The fixture is built so the failure is DETERMINISTIC rather than dependent
 * on how the random tenant UUIDs happen to sort:
 *
 *   - exactly one row (org A1, partner A) is UniFi-flagged, so statement 1's
 *     transition table contains only partner A's org;
 *   - the remaining NULL-source rows live in org A2 (partner A) AND in both of
 *     partner B's orgs, so statement 2 necessarily requests a lock on partner
 *     B — a NEW partner — while `breeze.partner_export_org_lock_held` is
 *     already '1'.
 *
 * Whichever way the UUIDs sort, that is the hierarchy violation.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS / WHAT IT DOES NOT. `replayMigration` runs as the superuser
 * test client, so this suite proves the LOCK ORDER, not the
 * `set_config('breeze.scope','system', true)` elevation — that is covered
 * statically by `src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts` in the unit job.
