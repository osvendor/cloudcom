/**
 * Foreign-key ledger for the GDPR org-erasure cascade (#4519).
 *
 * Enforced by `orgCascadeFkOnDelete.integration.test.ts`; that file's header
 * carries the full execution model. The short version: erasure empties a
 * tenant with a sequence of ordinary `DELETE` statements, so a foreign key
 * pointing at any table those statements touch is only safe if Postgres
 * clears it for us, or the referencing rows are already gone by the time that
 * statement runs. Anything else is an erasure failure that lies dormant until
 * a customer creates the first row in the referencing table -- exactly how
 * #4100 shipped.
 *
 * HOW TO USE THIS FILE
 *
 * You are here because the contract test failed. Do NOT reflexively add a
 * line. In order of preference:
 *
 *   1. Give the FK an explicit `ON DELETE` in a NEW, idempotent, fix-forward
 *      migration (never edit a shipped one). `CASCADE` when the child row is
 *      meaningless without the parent; `SET NULL` when it is an optional
 *      back-reference and `allColumnsNullable` is true. This is the answer for
 *      nearly every new FK.
 *   2. Register the child table in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` -- plus
 *      every other list CLAUDE.md's cascade-registration table demands (device
 *      cascade, export policy, ...). Only valid if the child has its own
 *      `org_id`.
 *   3. Add an `ASSOCIATED_SYSTEM_SCOPED_TABLES` pre-clear in
 *      `services/tenantCascade.ts`, then record the FK in
 *      `ORG_CASCADE_FK_PRE_CLEARED` below. For child tables with no tenancy
 *      column of their own.
 *   4. Only if none of the above fits, add a line to
 *      `ORG_CASCADE_FK_UNSAFE` -- and if its `reason` is anything other than
 *      `child-not-deleted`, the test requires a `note` explaining it.
 *
 * BURN-DOWN
 *
 * `ORG_CASCADE_FK_UNSAFE` is a debt ledger seeded from a live migrated
 * database on 2026-09-03 so the contract could land green. It is expected to
 * SHRINK. Entries come off it by fix-forward migration -- never by relaxing
 * the test. A stale entry (the FK was dropped, renamed, given an ON DELETE, or
 * its child table joined the cascade set) fails the burn-down test, so a
 * migration that fixes an edge forces the matching line out in the same PR.
 *
 * One entry is NOT a latent shape but an erasure failure that fires today for
 * any tenant with the relevant rows -- `restore_jobs`, carrying a note with its
 * SQLSTATE and fix. It is pinned rather than fixed because #4519 is explicitly
 * scoped to making the debt visible; the migration is follow-up work.
 * `script_categories.parent_id` was the second such entry and came off this
 * ledger in #4873: `2026-10-13-120000-script-categories-parent-ownership-guard.sql`
 * gave it `ON DELETE SET NULL` (all referencing columns nullable, so the
 * classifier now calls it safe on its own) and added the DEFERRABLE
 * `script_categories_parent_guard` so the offending shape cannot be built.
 *
 * A `note` is not a fix. The two `partner_export_*` entries carry a reviewed
 * argument for why their edge is unreachable in practice, so they are not debt
 * in the ordinary sense -- but they stay pinned precisely because that
 * argument is transitive and nothing enforces it.
 *
 * Scope: the ORG cascade only. The device cascade
 * (`CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES`) and the partner purge have their own
 * contracts.
