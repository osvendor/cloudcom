/**
 * Waiting for fire-and-forget audit rows.
 *
 * `writeRouteAudit` / `writeAuditEvent` (`services/auditEvents.ts`) do
 * `void writeAuditEventAsync(...)`, and `persistAuditLog`
 * (`services/auditService.ts`) deliberately runs the INSERT **outside** the
 * caller's request transaction — `runOutsideDbContext(() =>
 * withSystemDbAccessContext(...))`, i.e. on a second pooled connection. The
 * route therefore returns its response while the audit INSERT is still in
 * flight.
 *
 * A test that reads `audit_logs` straight after the response races that write:
 * it wins on an idle local database and loses on a loaded CI shard. A fixed
 * `setTimeout(300)` only moves the odds — it is still a race, and it also costs
 * 300 ms on every green run. #6554 replaced one such read with a bounded poll;
 * this helper is that poll, shared (issue #6555).
 *
 * Deliberately count-based and caller-driven: each suite keeps its own database
 * handle (`getTestDb()`, a fixture's `adminDb`, or a system-scoped
 * `withDbAccessContext` wrapper) and its own column selection, so the existing
 * assertions — which pin the exact actions, org ids and details — stay
 * untouched and keep producing their own failure messages.
 */

/**
 * Poll `read` until it returns **at least** `expectedCount` rows, or the
 * deadline passes.
 *
 * `>=`, not `===`, on purpose: an over-count is a real regression, and the
 * caller's own exact-length assertion is what should report it. Blocking here
 * would instead burn the whole timeout and report nothing useful.
 *
 * Returns the last rows read **without asserting**: on a real regression the
 * caller's own `expect` reports the mismatch with its own message. This only
 * removes the timing race — it never makes a failing assertion pass.
 *
 * Note this cannot prove an *absence*: waiting for zero rows is satisfied
 * immediately. Assertions that no audit row was written still need a plain
 * delay (and are the safe direction anyway — a slow write makes them pass
 * spuriously, not fail flakily).
