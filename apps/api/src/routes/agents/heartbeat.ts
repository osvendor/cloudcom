  // heartbeat path below still ingests metrics into device_metrics, updates IP

  // state and writes audit events — and its RESPONSE still carries configUpdate
  // (event-log/monitoring/PAM/patch-source/OneDrive/policy-probe settings),
  // agent + helper + watchdog upgrade targets, manifest trust keys and key
  // delegations, renewCert, and rotateToken/confirmTokenRotation. The Go agent
  // ACTS on every one of those (agent/internal/heartbeat), so a removed machine
  // would keep being configured, upgraded and re-keyed for the whole drain
  // window while the operator sees it as gone.
  //
  // So: claim and return the uninstall, nothing else. No device write either —
  // which is what keeps the device correctly showing as Removed (no lastSeenAt
  // bump, no status flip back to 'online', no state-change audit).
  //
  // Keyed on `deviceUninstallDraining`, NOT on `tenantDraining`: an offboarding
  // tenant's machines are still live, still owned by a paying customer until
  // the window closes, and #2774 deliberately keeps serving them a normal beat.

  // `data.role` mismatch is intentionally NOT re-checked here (the normal path
  // 401s `re_enrollment_required` on it). A stale pre-#568 watchdog binary
  // presenting the MAIN agent token would be told to re-enrol instead of being
  // handed the uninstall — turning a cosmetic version skew into an undeliverable
  // uninstall. Only agent-role credentials reach this branch anyway (Layer 1b).

  // re-adding the fields this branch exists to withhold. Two response fields
