 * Move a device between organizations (and into a site within the target org)

 * `org_id` from `devices.org_id` on every heartbeat / WS handshake, so the
 * column flip is sufficient to relocate the agent at runtime.
 *
 * The route is gated on:
 *   - scope ∈ {partner, system} — cross-org capability requires at minimum
 *     partner reach. Single-org callers can't see two orgs at once and
 *     therefore can't legitimately move between them.
 *   - devices:write AND organizations:write — relocating a device is both
 *     a device mutation and an org-membership mutation.
 *   - an interactive user session — API keys, MCP-OAuth grants and AI agents
 *     are denied unconditionally (requireInteractiveSession, spec 2026-09-18 D1)
 *   - an MFA-assured session (requireMfa) AND, while ENABLE_2FA is on, a fresh
 *     single-use step-up grant for operation 'device_move_org' bound to this
 *     exact { deviceId, orgId, siteId, acceptCurrencyMismatch } (D2/D3). The
 *     grant is validated before the transaction and consumed inside it, after
 *     a FOR SHARE lock on the actor row and BEFORE the organisation locks.
 *
 * Cross-partner moves are rejected even for partner-scoped callers; only
 * system scope can move a device across partner boundaries.
 *
 * RLS hazard: 64 device-scoped tables denormalize `org_id` for RLS perf
 * (see getDeviceOrgDenormalizedTables()). All of them MUST be rewritten in
 * the same transaction or pre-existing rows for this device will be
 * visible only to the OLD org and invisible to the NEW one. Tables that
 * denormalize org_id but have no device_id column (CUSTOM_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES)
 * get dedicated rewrites in the same
 * transaction.
 *
 * Audit: writes ONE audit row per org (source + target) so the move shows

        //  1. LOCK ORDER (#5005 review). The other writer of this pair is the
        //     correlation job (services/alertCorrelationGroups.ts), which
        //     upserts the GROUP and then its MEMBERS, in that order, on every
        //     pass. Taking them the other way round here is a textbook AB-BA:
        //     a correlation pass running concurrently over the same group
        //     deadlocks with this move and Postgres kills one with 40P01,
        //     surfacing as a 500 on an admin action. Same class of bug and same
        //     fix as the ticket-child order in
        //     services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts (#4657) — read that module for
        //     the precedent. This pair is not listed there because its
        //     counterpart is the correlation job rather than a second org-mover,
        //     but the rule is identical: state the order once, and align with
        //     the existing writer instead of reasoning locally.
        //  2. DATA DEPENDENCY, and it runs the same way. The member statement
        //     reads `alert_correlation_groups.org_id` as re-stamped by the group
        //     statement, and the verdict's group leg reads that same column.
        //     NOTHING reads `alert_correlation_members.org_id`: the group's
        //     "does this group still span two orgs?" guard reads `alerts.org_id`
        //     (re-stamped by the generic loop above), never the member row's own
        //     org. An earlier revision of this comment asserted the opposite —
        //     that member -> group -> verdict was load-bearing — and the order
        //     it justified was the deadlock in 1.
        //
        // Placement of the whole block is load-bearing too: AFTER the generic
        // loop, because the group guard reads alerts.org_id as re-stamped by it;
        // and AFTER the ticket chain above, so this extends — never reorders —
        // ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts's documented order. None of the three
        // carries a composite tenant FK, so there is no 23503 hazard of the kind
        // the ticket chain is ordered for.
        //
