 *

 * rolled the whole transaction back as a 500 — a self-hoster hit this on
 * 0.107.0.
 *
 * The constraint draws NO manual/auto distinction: a manually-linked asset
 * failed identically. 'auto' is simply what the bug report carried, and why no
 * manual-link report arrived is NOT established — do not read the reported
 * shape as the bug's boundary. (It is specifically not an API asymmetry:
 * #3261/#3295 removed the manual-only rule from the unlink route on
 * 2026-08-11, ten days before 0.107.0 was tagged, so by then that route

 *
 * Rows are DETACHED, never deleted: a discovered asset is a network-inventory
 * record about an endpoint that exists whether or not Breeze manages it, and
 * it carries operator-curated state (label, notes, tags, approval/dismissal,

 * (undefined_column) — a 500 either way.
 *
 * `auto_link_suppressed_at` is deliberately ABSENT. It is a durable record of

 * moveOrg.coverage.test.ts. Its org_id is trigger-immutable
 * (2026-09-06-a-agent-runs-org-immutable.sql).
 *
 * ai_operator_tasks is deliberately ABSENT for the same reason (#5205 W03,
 * #5208): AI Operator task history stays in the org that delegated the work.
 * `org_id` is the task's immutable tenant and anchors seven composite
 * (x, org_id) FKs, so a restamp here would 23503 the moment the task has an
 * operation, an outbox wake, a target, a step, an event, a linked run or a
 * linked intent. moveOrg detaches instead —

 * task. It is listed in INTENTIONALLY_NO_ORG_ID in moveOrg.coverage.test.ts.
 *
 * ai_operator_task_targets is deliberately ABSENT for exactly the same reason
 * (recipe library E2, #6167): a target's org_id IS its task's org_id and

 * while the task stayed behind. moveOrg detaches instead. It is listed in

 * an org_id column but is cascade-deleted, not moved. (a) Exposure history
 * stays with the org the unattended action ran in — the same
 * ai_agent_runs owner decision above — and re-stamping it would attribute
 * the old org's unattended-action count to the new org, corrupting the cap
 * the ledger exists to enforce. (b) The generic move-org loop UPDATEs
 * org_id alone, which would violate the (org_id, partner_id) →
 * organizations(id, partner_id) composite FK the moment the two orgs sit
 * under different partners — the same reason recorded in the
 * orgMergeRegistry entry for this table. It is listed in

 *
 * ai_agent_fix_watches is deliberately ABSENT too (wave 6 PR 2, #3828): it
 * has both org_id and device_id columns but is cascade-deleted, not moved —
 * identical reasoning to ai_unattended_exposure above, transplanted to
 * watch history: (a) a fix-held watch's org attribution stays with the run
 * it watches, which itself never follows a device move (ai_agent_runs is
 * ABSENT from this same list, above), so re-stamping the watch's org_id
 * while its run stays under the old org would split one remediation's
 * story across two orgs; (b) the same (org_id, partner_id) composite FK
 * fragility applies the moment the two orgs sit under different partners.
 * It is listed in INTENTIONALLY_NO_ORG_ID in moveOrg.coverage.test.ts.
 *
 * invoice_line_devices is deliberately ABSENT too (#3205 W07): it has both
 * org_id and device_id, but its org_id belongs to the INVOICE, which does not
 * move. Re-stamping it would break the (invoice_line_id, org_id) and
 * (invoice_id, org_id) composite FKs. It is additionally excluded from
 * breeze_device_child_orgid_tables() by migration
 * 2026-10-08-101300-device-move-exclude-billing-evidence.sql, because that
 * trigger would otherwise restamp it mid-UPDATE and raise 23503 before any
 * route code runs. moveOrg detaches device_id instead — an explicit,
 * LOAD-BEARING statement, not a mirror of the generic loop. It is listed in
 * INTENTIONALLY_NO_ORG_ID in moveOrg.coverage.test.ts.
 *
 * script_executions IS in the list below and so re-stamps normally, but its AI
 * ORIGIN POINTERS are detached on the way (#5022 W01): ai_agent_runs above is
 * not re-stamped and ai_sessions is re-stamped only when device-bound, so a
 * moved execution could otherwise keep pointing at a session or run in the

 * privileged mechanism, so move-org must NOT also issue its ordinary
 * app-role UPDATE against them (breeze_app lacks UPDATE on some of these,
 * and for the rest it would just be redundant with what already ran).
 *
 * Two different mechanisms populate this list:
 *  - `agent_health_observations` / `software_inventory_observations`: a
 *    composite FK on `devices(id, org_id)` declared `ON UPDATE CASCADE`, so
 *    PostgreSQL's own referential action restamps them the instant the
 *    `devices` row's org_id changes (line ~234's `.update(devices)` above)
 *    — immutable evidence can only be restamped this way, never by a
 *    direct app-role UPDATE.
 *  - `agent_rollback_events` (#4371 fixup): breeze_app has UPDATE revoked
 *    entirely (see ensureAppRole.ts's writer-path matrix), so restamping it
 *    the ordinary way here would 42501. It does NOT have its own `ON
 *    UPDATE CASCADE` FK (only `ON DELETE CASCADE` — ON UPDATE defaults to
 *    NO ACTION, so it must actually be re-tenanted, not just left alone).
 *    That happens via `breeze_cascade_device_org_id()` (migrations/
 *    2026-05-18-device-child-orgid-cascade.sql) instead: a SECURITY
 *    DEFINER trigger on `devices` (AFTER UPDATE OF org_id) that discovers
 *    every ordinary table with both a uuid `device_id` and `org_id` column
 *    and restamps it under the function owner's privileges, bypassing
 *    breeze_app's revoke the same way FK actions do. It fires as a row
 *    trigger on the SAME `.update(devices)` statement above, so by the
 *    time this loop runs, agent_rollback_events.org_id is already correct
 *    — verified against real Postgres:
 *    `SELECT * FROM breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()` includes it.
 *    (`pam_actuation_results` is deliberately EXCLUDED from that same
 *    discovery function — migrations/2026-09-17-pam-device-move-guard.sql
 *    — because a device with PAM history cannot move orgs at all; see
 *    devices_pam_history_move_guard / PamDeviceMoveBlockedError below.)
 *  - `peripheral_policy_delivery_events` (#4806 fixup): same shape as
 *    `agent_rollback_events` above — breeze_app now has UPDATE revoked
 *    entirely (see ensureAppRole.ts's writer-path matrix), and the table
 *    has a uuid `device_id` + `org_id` pair but no `ON UPDATE CASCADE` FK,
 *    so `breeze_cascade_device_org_id()`'s auto-discovery restamps it
 *    instead — verified the same way, via `breeze_device_child_orgid_
 *    tables()`. Before #4806, breeze_app kept a real UPDATE grant on this
 *    table specifically so this loop's statement could restamp it; that
 *    grant is what the fixup revoked, since the cascade trigger already
 *    made the app-level UPDATE redundant.

 *
 * Leaving them behind is not a neutral no-op: every alert-facing reader pins

 * `correlationMetadataCondition` (routes/alerts/alerts.ts), plus
 * `latestVerdictsForAlerts` / `latestVerdictForGroup`
 * (services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts.ts) — so a row still stamped with the

 * regenerates them: the verdict scheduler is event-driven off `alert.triggered`
 * (jobs/alertVerdictScheduler.ts) and never re-scans existing alerts.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — group -> member -> verdict — and, unlike the ticket
 * list's, the primary reason is a LOCK ORDER (#5005 review). The correlation
 * job (services/alertCorrelationGroups.ts) upserts the GROUP and then its
 * MEMBERS on every pass; a mover that took them the other way round would form
 * an AB-BA with a concurrent correlation pass and lose one side to 40P01.
 * Aligning with the existing writer is the same discipline
 * services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts encodes for the ticket axis (#4657).
 *
 * The data dependency runs the same way and is downstream only: the member
 * statement reads `alert_correlation_groups.org_id` as re-stamped by the group
 * statement, and the verdict's group leg reads that same column. Nothing reads
 * `alert_correlation_members.org_id` — the group's "does this group still span
 * two orgs?" guard reads `alerts.org_id` from the generic loop, never the
 * member row's own org. (Before #5005's follow-up this comment claimed the
 * reverse order was load-bearing for that reason; it was not.)
 *
 * None of the three carries a composite tenant FK, so there is no 23503
 * ordering hazard of the kind the ticket chain above is ordered for. These
 * statements run AFTER that chain, extending — never reordering —
 * services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts's documented order.
 *
 * moveOrg.coverage.test.ts DERIVES the expected membership from the schema
 * (org_id + no device_id + an FK path to `alerts`), so the next alert child

    //
    //  1. TOCTOU closed. The `status !== 'decommissioned'` check above runs
    //     OUTSIDE this transaction and used never to be re-checked, so a
    //     Restore committing in between was silently purged. The service takes
    //     `devices FOR UPDATE` first and re-reads status under it; the loser
    //     of that race now gets 409 NOT_REMOVED.
    //  2. The best-effort WS `self_uninstall` this route used to fire after the
    //     commit is GONE, and the route now REFUSES (409 UNINSTALL_PENDING)
    //     while a `device_remove` uninstall is still collectable. The old
    //     dispatch only ever reached a CONNECTED agent — and decommissioning,
    //     a precondition of getting here, force-closes that socket — while the
    //     cascade it followed had just deleted the device's own
    //     `device_commands` rows, i.e. the durable uninstall (#3986) that
    //     would have cleaned the endpoint on the agent's next check-in.
    //     Destroying that and firing a command nobody can receive is strictly
    //     worse than telling the operator to wait. The response therefore
    //     drops `agentUninstallSent`/`warning`: there is nothing best-effort
    //     left to report.
    // #5023 wave 05 — the cascade runs in a SYSTEM db context, matching
    // `jobs/deviceBulkPurge.ts`'s `purgeOne`. Before this wave, the cascade ran
    // under the CALLER's tenant-scoped context (the one `withDbAccessContext`
    // opened for this request), and `services/deviceDeletion.ts` documents that
    // at least one cascade table (`abuse_endpoint_fingerprints`) is
    // deliberately invisible under tenant RLS policy — so this single-device
    // path could strand rows that bulk purge (which has always run in a system
    // context) removes cleanly.
    //
    // Authorisation is unaffected and stays exactly where it is: both the
    // `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck` chokepoint above and the decommissioned
    // pre-check just above run BEFORE this escalation, entirely inside the
    // ordinary tenant-scoped request context. A caller who fails either check
    // never reaches a system-scoped connection.
    //
    // `runOutsideDbContext` MUST wrap `withSystemDbAccessContext`, not the
    // other way around: this route is already inside the request's
    // `withDbAccessContext` transaction (the auth middleware opens one for
    // every request — #1105), and opening a second nested context without
    // first exiting the first would pin two pooled connections for the
    // duration of this call instead of one (CLAUDE.md's DB context helpers
    // contract).
    //
    // `purgeRemovedDevice`'s own `SELECT ... devices FOR UPDATE` + status
    // re-check still runs, now strictly BETTER than before: under system
    // context the devices row is fully visible, so that lock actually holds. In
    // the old tenant-scoped path, an RLS-filtered row would have silently
    // locked nothing (see the `deviceDeletion.ts` comment on
