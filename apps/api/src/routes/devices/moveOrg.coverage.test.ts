 * ALERT_CHILD_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES (#4867) — the alert-axis sibling of the

 *
 * These tables denormalize `org_id` and hang off `alerts`, but have NO
 * `device_id` column, so the generic getDeviceOrgDenormalizedTables() loop in
 * moveOrg.ts cannot reach them — and neither can the DB-side
 * breeze_cascade_device_org_id() trigger, which discovers its table set BY the
 * device_id column (`breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()`). Each gets a
 * dedicated hand-written UPDATE keyed on the alert (or the correlation group)
 * instead.
 *
 * Unlike the ticket-axis list, the expected membership here is DERIVED from
 * the schema rather than hand-enumerated: any org-scoped table that references
 * `alerts` (directly, or one hop through another such table) without carrying
 * its own device_id belongs in this list, so the next alert child cannot
 * repeat #4867 by skipping both paths. `ticket_alert_links` is the one derived
 * name that is deliberately NOT here — it is the ticket axis's row and is
 * already rewritten by CUSTOM_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES.
 *
 * LIMIT OF THIS GUARD (#5005 review): the derivation walks
 * `getTableConfig(table).foreignKeys`, which sees only the FKs DECLARED in the
 * Drizzle schema — not the ones that exist solely in a migration. Nothing in
 * this repo forces the two to agree: `pnpm db:check-drift` compares the schema
 * against the migrations' DDL for columns, but drizzle-kit does not surface a
 * migration-only FK as drift the schema must adopt (the same gap
 * `aiAlertVerdicts.supersededBy`'s DEFERRABLE note and
 * `deviceMtlsCertificates`' composite FK already call out from the other
 * direction). So a future alert child whose only link to `alerts` is an FK
 * added in raw SQL — or one that reaches alerts through an untyped uuid column
 * with no FK at all — is invisible here and will be missed exactly the way
 * #4867 was. When adding such a table, add it to ALERT_CHILD_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES
 * by hand; the `stale` assertion below will then flag it, which is the prompt
 * to declare the FK in the Drizzle schema too.

 * ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.test.ts asserts only that the two lists AGREE — it has

 * This derives the expected membership from the Drizzle schema instead: every
 * table carrying BOTH ticket_id and org_id must be in
 * TICKET_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES or in the documented exemption set below.
 * Same shape as the ALERT_CHILD_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES guard above, and the same
 * lesson as the cascade-list history: contract tests 5/5, code review 0/5.
 *
 * This block lives here rather than in ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.test.ts (a
 * deliberate deviation from spec #5783 §9): that file's header makes being
 * schema-free and DB-free a stated property, while this one already imports the
 * Drizzle schema and already carries a structurally identical guard. Both run

/**
 * ai_agent_runs run-lineage detach coverage (#3828 branch-review blocker 2).
 *
 * ai_agent_runs deliberately does NOT follow the device on a cross-org move
 * (owner decision 2026-08-23 — see CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES'
 * comment above): run history stays with the SOURCE org, and moveOrg.ts
 * instead severs every FK column that points at a row which DOES move with
 * the device (either the device row itself, or a table returned by
 * getDeviceOrgDenormalizedTables()). Left un-severed, such a column would
 * point across tenants the moment its target is re-stamped to the
 * destination org — exactly the bug this blocker fixes for
 * `anomaly_incident_id`.
 *
 * The detach is duplicated in two places that must stay in sync: moveOrg.ts's
 * UPDATEs and breeze_cascade_device_org_id()'s identical UPDATEs (the DB-side
 * trigger, for direct-SQL/non-route callers). Each site needs TWO statements,
 * not one: `WHERE device_id = <moved>` cannot reach `ticket_id`, because
 * ticket-triggered runs are device-less (trigger_kind 'ticket' stamps
 * ticket_id and leaves device_id NULL), so ticket_id is severed by its own
 * `WHERE ticket_id IN (SELECT id FROM tickets WHERE device_id = <moved>)`
 * statement — the same join shape the ticket_attachments / time_entries /
 * ticket_parts org rewrites already use (#4215).
 *
 * This block derives the expected column set from the ai_agent_runs schema's
 * own FK columns — not a hand-maintained list — and checks BOTH halves of each
 * `UPDATE ai_agent_runs` statement at each site: which columns it nulls AND
 * which predicate it nulls them under. Presence alone is not enough — folding
 * `ticket_id = NULL` back into the device-keyed statement re-introduces #4215
 * (it would null nothing on a device-less run) while still satisfying a plain
 * set-equality check. So the next FK added to this table can neither skip both
 * detach sites the way anomaly_incident_id (#3828) did, nor be severed under a
 * predicate that cannot reach it the way ticket_id (#4215) was.
 *
 * Scope limits worth knowing:
 *  - This guards the DEVICE-move axis only. `moveTicketOrg`
 *    (services/ticketService.ts) moves a TICKET between orgs of the same
 *    partner and does NOT sever ai_agent_runs.ticket_id — same
 *    cross-tenant-pointer class, different axis, and (unlike ticket_drafts /
 *    action_intents there) it does not self-announce via a composite tenant FK,
 *    since ai_agent_runs.ticket_id is a plain single-column FK. Still open.
 *  - Both detach statements are org-blind, by inheritance from the device-keyed
 *    one: a run that already lives in the TARGET org and names the moved ticket
 *    is severed too, even though the pointer would have become legitimate
 *    post-move. Accepted — severing run lineage is the point.

 *
 * `device_vulnerabilities` IS returned by breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()
 * / getDeviceOrgDenormalizedTables(), so the generic re-stamp loop already
 * moves a finding's org_id to the destination org unconditionally — the
 * finding always travels with its device. Its remediation ticket does not:
 * `POST /vulnerabilities/tickets` (routes/vulnerabilities.ts) creates the
 * ticket org-scoped only and never sets tickets.device_id, so the SAME loop
 * (which also re-stamps `tickets` for any ticket bound to the moved device)
 * never reaches it — it stays behind in the source org.
 *
 * Unlike scope_ticket_id above, `ticket_id` is a PLAIN single-column FK
 * (`ON DELETE SET NULL`, not composite tenant-FK'd), so this is a tenancy-
 * hygiene detach, not a 23503-avoidance one — and the ORDERING requirement is
 * the OPPOSITE of scope_ticket_id's: this statement must run AFTER the
 * generic loop, not before, because it compares against the referenced
 * ticket's ACTUAL (possibly just-restamped) org_id. Checked before the loop,
 * a ticket bound to the SAME moving device (still holding its stale source
 * org_id at that point) would be wrongly nulled even though it is about to
 * become valid once the loop restamps it.
 *
 * These are STATIC source assertions only. That the statement actually
 * matches rows (and correctly SPARES a same-device-bound ticket) against a
 * real server lives in

 * device_group_memberships cross-org detach coverage (#3182).

 * `device_group_memberships` is tenant-scoped by its own `org_id` column

 * PRODUCED the resulting forged shape, because the table qualifies for
 * `breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()`'s auto-discovery and so had its org_id
 * re-stamped to the target org while its group_id kept naming the SOURCE org's
 * group. Two system-context readers then dereferenced those rows by group_id.
 *
 * The structural fix is two composite FKs — `(group_id, org_id) ->
 * device_groups(id, org_id)` and `(device_id, org_id) -> devices(id, org_id)`
 * — which means the memberships must now be DELETED on a move rather than
 * re-stamped, before the generic re-stamp loop that would otherwise 23503.
 *
 * The DEVICE-axis FK's deferrability is the one non-stylistic detail here and
 * is pinned below: it references `devices(id, org_id)`, so the `UPDATE devices
 * SET org_id` statement fires its RI check as an AFTER-row constraint trigger
 * on `devices` — the same queue, at the same moment, as
 * `breeze_cascade_device_org_id()`, whose detach is what makes the check pass.
 * Same-timing AFTER-row triggers run in trigger-NAME order, which no migration
 * controls, so INITIALLY DEFERRED (not IMMEDIATE) is what actually makes the
 * move deterministic. A BEFORE trigger cannot substitute: memberships carry
 * `breeze_touch_devices_after_membership_delete`, which UPDATEs `devices`, so
 * deleting them before the row update aborts with SQLSTATE 27000.
 *
 * These are STATIC source assertions only. That the move actually stops
 * 23503ing, that the rows really disappear, and that the merge fence spares

/**
 * #4622 — `manual_assets` cross-org detach.
 *
 * `manual_assets` is org-scoped hand-entered inventory that may point at the
 * agent device an engineer later installed, through the composite FK
 * `(linked_device_id, org_id) -> devices(id, org_id)`. It has NO `device_id`
 * column, so the generic re-stamp loop cannot reach it, and it is deliberately
 * absent from `CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES` — a link-only table is not
 * device-managed, and the "all listed tables are also device-managed"
 * assertion above would report it as an orphan.
 *
 * Once the device leaves the org the link is not merely stale but
 * unrepresentable, so the route nulls it. Placement is load-bearing and
 * STRICTER than the `device_group_memberships` precedent above:
 * `device_group_memberships_device_org_fk` is DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, so
 * its detach may sit after the `devices` row flip.
 * `manual_assets_linked_device_org_fk` is DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE (the
 * CLAUDE.md default for a composite FK referencing an `org_id` column), so its
 * referential check fires at the end of the `UPDATE devices SET org_id`
 * statement itself — a detach placed after that flip is already too late and
 * the move aborts with 23503. Hence: BEFORE the devices update, not merely
 * before the loop.
 *
 * No mirror in `breeze_cascade_device_org_id()`: that trigger runs in the same
 * after-row queue as the IMMEDIATE RI check, so its ordering relative to the
 * check is decided by trigger name and could not be relied on. The only other
 * writer of `devices.org_id` is the org merge, which runs `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL
 * DEFERRED` and re-points `manual_assets` wholesale via `orgMergeRegistry`
 * REPOINT_TABLES — a merge must NOT detach.
 *
 * These are STATIC source assertions. That the move really stops 23503ing is
 * proved against live Postgres in
