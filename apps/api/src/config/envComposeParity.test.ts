/**
 * Why this test exists
 * --------------------
 * Neither compose file uses `env_file: .env` — they hand-thread each variable
 * into a service `environment:` block as `${VAR:-default}`. That is deliberate
 * (least-privilege per container, `:?required` fail-fast, baked defaults,
 * derived values, file-backed secrets), but it has a sharp edge: a variable
 * documented in the paired `.env.example` that nobody added to a service block
 * is **silently inert** — setting it in `.env` does nothing.
 *
 * This has shipped bad deploys repeatedly (IS_HOSTED / #570, the release key,
 * and — the reason this test exists — a self-hoster whose CORS/2FA/platform-admin
 * settings all no-op'd because they were never threaded through Compose).
 *
 * The guard, per env-example ↔ compose pair: every variable DOCUMENTED in the
 * `.env.example` — live assignments AND commented-out defaults alike, see
 * documentedEnvExampleVars() — MUST be either
 *   (a) referenced in the compose file (mapped into a container, sourced into a
 *       secret, or used for interpolation), or
 *   (b) listed in that pair's allow-list below with a reason.
 * Adding a documented var without doing one of those two fails CI here, in the
 * required test-api job, instead of silently in someone's production deploy.
 *
 * Mapping a var in costs nothing when the operator leaves it unset: the
 * `${VAR:-}` form passes an empty string, which every consumer below treats as
 * "unset" and falls back to its own default. Where a consumer did NOT treat ''
 * that way, the consumer was fixed rather than the var left unmapped — see
 * resolveAuthCookieSameSite() in routes/auth/helpers.ts, which resolves its
 * override chain with nested envStr() instead of `??` for exactly this reason
 * (#3239).

/**
 * Every variable the `.env.example` DOCUMENTS — both live assignments

 *
 * Commenting a line out is how this repo documents an OPTIONAL tuning knob
 * while leaving the code's own default in force, so the commented form carries
 * exactly the same promise to the operator as the uncommented one: "set this in
 * .env and it takes effect". Reading only uncommented lines therefore exempted
 * the entire optional-knob surface from the guard — the class most likely to be
 * forgotten, since an unmapped optional var still boots fine and just silently
 * ignores the operator (#3239; #3236 was one instance, #3224 got wired only by
 * hand).
 *
 * Only `# NAME=` is collected, not prose. A comment has to look like an
 * assignment to count, so ordinary explanatory text above a var is not mistaken
 * for a documented knob.
 *
 * Prose that OPENS with `# SOME_VAR=value` — e.g. the sentence at
 * `.env.example` "# OAUTH_DCR_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true. The API refuses to boot…" —
 * does match, and that is the deliberate bias. Such a line is indistinguishable
 * from a real documented default without parsing English, and this guard exists
 * to fail LOUD: a spurious hit costs one allow-list line, while the miss it
 * would otherwise permit is a knob that silently ignores the operator forever.
