/**
 * Pool-health watchdog for the postgres.js connection-poisoning failure (#3214).
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT WATCHES FOR. Unpatched postgres.js 3.4.9 leaves a pooled
 * connection permanently unable to flush a deferred write once its socket dies
 * with one buffered. A poisoned slot then reconnects forever, timing out at
 * `connect_timeout` every time. Slots are lost one at a time (in the production
 * incident: 35 configured, 9 live after a few hours) and only an API restart
 * recovers them.
 *
 * THAT DEFECT IS NOW REPAIRED by `patches/postgres@3.4.9.patch` (#3225), and
 * `db/postgresJsPoolPoisoning.test.ts` asserts the repair holds. This watchdog
 * predates the patch and stays as defense-in-depth: it detects pool
 * degradation from ANY cause — including the patch silently ceasing to apply
 * (e.g. a postgres version bump that drops `patchedDependencies`), which is
 * exactly the failure the test's message warns about. If its `pool-degraded`
 * verdict ever fires again, check the patch is still applying before assuming
 * a new driver bug. This module cannot repair the pool; what it does is
 * collapse the diagnosis — which took hours of manual work during the
 * 2026-08-07 incident — into a single automatic verdict.
 *
 * THE DIAGNOSTIC TRICK. A sustained CONNECT_TIMEOUT rate on its own is
 * ambiguous: it looks identical whether the database is unreachable or the pool
 * is poisoned. The two are told apart by opening a BRAND NEW, single-use
 * connection to the same database, outside the main pool. A fresh postgres.js
 * client gets fresh connection closures, so it is immune to the poisoning:
 *
 *   - fresh connection succeeds  -> the DB is fine and the POOL is the problem
 *   - fresh connection also fails -> a real database/network fault
 *
 * That is exactly the manual step ("`psql` from the same host connected in under
 * a second") that ended the incident's guessing, performed automatically.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE NEVER CLAIMS. There is no `healthy` verdict, on purpose. The
 * only evidence it has is a connect-timeout count that `dbConnectTimeoutStats`
 * documents as a FLOOR, and it does not observe pool slot occupancy at all — so
 * a pool that has quietly lost most of its slots while producing few
 * request-visible timeouts is below threshold, not proven well. The quiet verdict
 * is therefore named `below-threshold`, and every message states the measurement
 * rather than only the conclusion. Publishing an affirmative all-clear from
 * evidence that cannot support one is the failure mode this whole area of the
 * codebase exists to avoid.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not recycle or replace the `sql`
 * instance. `db/index.ts` hands the client to Drizzle at module load, and the
 * resulting `baseDb` is captured by the exported proxy, by every open
 * `withDbAccessContext` transaction, and by the AsyncLocalStorage stores.
 * Swapping it mid-flight would abort in-flight tenant transactions, and a bug in
 * that swap is a whole-API outage. Recycling is tracked separately; this module
 * is warn-only by design.

//
// A SECOND, INDEPENDENT signal, deliberately not folded into the verdict above.
// The #3214 watchdog only probes once the CONNECT_TIMEOUT rate crosses a
// threshold, and the #6048 incident produced zero connect timeouts: one slot
// quietly disappeared and the pool absorbed it for three days. Gating this scan
// on that rate would therefore have missed the very failure it exists to catch.
//
// It also cannot be answered from inside the process. The client has no way to
// tell "this connection is wedged" from "this connection is busy" — the
// evidence lives in `pg_stat_activity`, on the server. So the scan runs on its
// own slower cadence over its own fresh side connection (see db/wedgedBackends.ts).
//
// Reclaim (#6348). This detector originally only reported, leaving termination
// to the prologue deadline. Four occurrences in prod proved that insufficient:
// the wedged connection was one NO caller was awaiting (its prologue deadline
// was armed before pool wait/connect, and the reclaim it requested required an
// `xact_start` older than 15 s that a freshly connected backend never had), so
// the detector logged the wedge every 5 minutes and nothing ever cleared it.
//
// So when the wide scan sees a backend in the prologue shape, the scanner now
// requests a pass through the SAME `requestWedgedBackendReclaim` path the
// deadline uses — never a direct `pg_terminate_backend` from this threshold.
// That keeps every existing safety bound: the narrow server-side predicate
// (same role + db, client backend, active/ClientRead, breeze prologue
// `set_config` only), the two-snapshot "has not moved" confirmation, the
// per-pass cap, single-flight, and the interval floor. When the scanner starts
// its own pass, the age clock is floored at 5 minutes regardless of the
// detector's own threshold. If a prologue-deadline pass is already in flight,
// the scanner joins it instead (single-flight), and that pass keeps its own
// shorter deadline-derived floor. That is no weaker than before this change,
// because the deadline path already ran that pass independently. Kill-switch: DB_WEDGED_BACKEND_SCANNER_RECLAIM_DISABLED (and the
// global DB_WEDGED_BACKEND_RECLAIM_DISABLED).

/**
 * What the scanner did about reclaim on this pass.
 *  - `not-needed`: no wedged row had the prologue shape (or the scan failed).
