/**
 * Ensures a non-superuser, non-BYPASSRLS role `breeze_app` exists and has the
 * minimum privileges required to run the API. The main DATABASE_URL typically
 * points at a superuser (e.g. the Postgres image's POSTGRES_USER), which
 * bypasses every RLS policy. The API should connect as `breeze_app` instead so
 * that row-level security is actually enforced.
 *
 * This runs from autoMigrate (which connects as the admin) because that is the
 * one place at startup where we have an admin connection and can afford to do
 * DDL. It is idempotent and safe to re-run.
 *
 * Returns `true` if the role was created/updated, `false` if the call was
 * skipped because neither password env var is set. Callers that need
 * `breeze_app` to exist (e.g. autoMigrate, before applying RLS-policy
 * migrations) should check the return value and fail fast with a pointed
 * error rather than let Postgres surface an unrelated-looking
 * `role "breeze_app" does not exist` failure many files later.
