/**
 * Report schedule worker.
 *
 * Executes saved reports whose `schedule` is daily/weekly/monthly. Until this
 * worker existed the builder let users pick a cadence (persisted on
 * `reports.schedule` + `config.schedule.{time,day,date}`) but nothing ever ran
 * them — schedules were silently dead.
 *
 * - `check-schedules` repeats every 5 minutes, computes each report's most
 *   recent scheduled occurrence in the org's timezone (org -> partner -> UTC
 *   chain, same resolution the rest of the platform uses), and enqueues a run
 *   when `lastGeneratedAt` predates that occurrence.
 * - `run-scheduled-report` mirrors the on-demand POST /reports/:id/generate
 *   path: insert a report_runs row, generateReport, store the snapshot. When
 *   `config.emailRecipients` is set, recipients get an email with the branded
 *   PDF attached for PDF-format reports (rendered server-side via
 *   @breeze/shared/reportPdf) or a CSV attachment for tabular formats — either
 *   way, plus an in-app link.
 * - Without Redis the check falls back to inline processing, matching the
 *   other queue workers.

 * run's own transaction rather than generated.
 *

 * definition has `execution_scope_user_id IS NULL` by construction, so it fails
 * `completeExecutableScope` forever — and without this exclusion the operator
 * signal would climb by one per org, per narrative schedule, pointing at rows
 * nobody can or should reauthorize.
 *
 * Fleet Designer W01 (#5651) added `ai_fleet_design`. Its definition's own
 * `schedule` column is `'one_time'`, so it is already excluded from the
 * `pollable` predicate below by the `ne(reports.schedule, 'one_time')` clause
 * alone — but it needs to be in THIS list too, for the same "requires scope
 * reauthorization" warning-count exclusion the narrative needed, and for the
 * defense-in-depth check at the execute-path call site below
 * (`WORKER_EXCLUDED_REPORT_TYPES.includes(report.type)`).
 *
 * Exported for `reportScheduleWorker.contract.test.ts` (#4248 W03), which pins
 * both enforcement sites and the list's parity with the route-side
