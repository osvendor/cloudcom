 * keys the previous tick was still holding — that overlap is what the waiting

 * grace period for rollups that land after the tick that would otherwise have
 * been their only chance.
 *
 * Trade-off, stated plainly: the old 30-minute window self-healed a missed tick
 * for 20 minutes. This one does not — a tick that is skipped, coalesced, or
 * lock-contended leaves buckets uncovered, and the recovery path is an explicit
 * `enqueueMetricAnomalyBackfill` over the missed range rather than "the next
