/**
 * AI Deployment-Invite Funnel Tool
 *
 * get_invite_funnel (Tier 1): Returns per-tenant deployment-invite funnel
 * metrics for the MCP bootstrap flow. The agent polls this during a deployment
 * so it can report "3 of 5 devices online so far" back to the user.
 *
 * Named `get_fleet_status` until #5362: the name read as a fleet overview, so
 * the model picked it for "Show fleet status" and narrated "your fleet is
 * empty" from this tool's zeros on a 51-device tenant that had never used
 * invites. The name is what wins tool selection — keep it funnel-specific.
 *
 * The response shape is intentionally minimal and bootstrap-focused: it does
 * not overlap with `get_fleet_health` (reliability scoring) or `query_devices`
 * (general search). It's the companion read tool for `send_deployment_invites`.
 *
 * Scoped by partner via the authed API key. Readonly-scope keys can call it
 * (it's a Tier 1 read tool), so a pre-payment tenant can still see an empty
 * funnel snapshot. Task 6.2 of the MCP bootstrap plan.
