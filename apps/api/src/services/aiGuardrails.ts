 *    `update`, where featureType is not a required input.
 *
 *  - an inlineSettings payload that would leave HP CMSL warranty collection
 *    ON (#5511 W02, contract D4). Enabling it installs HP's CMSL module on
 *    every HP endpoint the policy reaches, which is a software deployment —
 *    gated behind devices.execute + MFA on the HTTP routes, and this tool
 *    reaches addFeatureLink without passing through any of them. Keyed on the
 *    SETTINGS CONTENT rather than on featureType precisely because featureType
 *    is not a required input on `update`, which is the call that turns
 *    collection on for an existing link. A warranty link carrying only alert
 *    thresholds installs nothing and deliberately stays at the base tier.
 *
 * The action guard is not decoration: without it a read (`list`) carrying a
 * stray featureType or inlineSettings argument would be escalated into an

 * MFA — what substitutes for the routes' `requireMfa()` (2026-09-17 audit §2.5).
 *
 * Several routes mirrored here add `requireMfa()` on top of their permission
 * gate: remote sessions (routes/remote/index.ts:16), device commands
 * (routes/devices/commands.ts:49), ticket move_org (routes/tickets/moveOrg.ts:23),
 * group delete (routes/groups.ts:784). This file has NO MFA concept and
 * deliberately does not invent one — there is no per-tool MFA hook anywhere on
 * the chat or MCP tool path.
 *
 * VERIFIED, and it is not the tier gate:
 *  - CHAT is already MFA-gated at its own entry point. Every tool call rides
 *    `POST /ai/sessions/:id/messages`, which carries `requireMfa()`
 *    (routes/ai.ts:654), as does session creation (:190). `requireMfa` passes
 *    only when the JWT carries `mfa === true` — i.e. the token was minted after
 *    MFA verification — or when 2FA is disabled deployment-wide
 *    (`hasSatisfiedMfa`, middleware/auth.ts:936-939). So a chat tool call is
 *    exactly as MFA-verified as a direct call to the equivalent route, and the
 *    parity these routes ask for is already satisfied. Nothing needs adding to
 *    `create_remote_session` or `manage_tickets.move_org` on this axis.
 *  - MCP is NOT MFA-gated: `routes/mcpServer.ts` authenticates API keys and
 *    contains no `requireMfa` / `hasSatisfiedMfa` call. What stands in there is
 *    the TIER gate — a Tier 3 tool is denied outright over MCP because that
 *    transport has no interactive approval surface (`isMcpApprovalRequired`,
 *    mcpServer.ts:994) — plus per-tier scopes. That is a different control, not
 *    the same one: it proves the key's authority, not possession of a second
 *    factor. Every MFA-carrying route mirrored above maps to a Tier 3 tool, so
 *    the tools are unreachable over MCP rather than reachable without MFA.
 *
 * The one place this reasoning had a hole was a tool whose route requires MFA
 * while the tool sat at Tier 1 — reachable over MCP with no gate of either
 * kind. That was `registry_operations` read_key/get_value, fixed above (§2.4).
 * Keep the invariant: a tool mirroring a `requireMfa()` route must be at least
 * Tier 2, and Tier 3 if the route mutates.
