/**
 * The ONE validation contract for "run this saved script on these devices".
 *
 * Lives in a dependency-free leaf module (only zod + the shared parameter
 * schema) rather than in `routes/scripts.ts`, so a non-route caller can reuse
 * the exact same schema object without importing a route module. That matters
 * for the AI tool path (#4888): `run_script` and the Script Builder's
 * `execute_script_on_device` let an assistant choose the run context, and an
 * assistant-chosen `runAs` must clear the SAME gate a human-chosen one does.
 * A second, hand-copied enum next to the tool definition is exactly how the
 * two would drift — and the direction they drift in is "the model can ask for
 * something the API would have refused a person".
 *
 * `routes/scripts.ts` re-exports `executeScriptSchema` so its existing
 * importers (and its co-located schema test) keep their import path.
