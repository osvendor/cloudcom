  // permanent delete racing any of them on the same device is a textbook AB-BA
  // deadlock (Postgres 40P01, the class of failure #3739 fixed as BREEZE-1S).
  //
  // A SELECT ... FOR UPDATE restores devices-first ordering without violating
  // the FK delete order, and gives the cascade a serialization point against
  // concurrent agent writes. It must stay the FIRST statement here: this
  // function is the single choke point both the route and the Quick Support
  // reaper go through, so the lock cannot be forgotten by a new caller.
  //
  // IMPORTANT — the guarantee is conditional, and issuing this statement is NOT
  // the same as holding the lock. FOR UPDATE locks only rows the statement can
  // SEE, so it locks nothing when the device row is already gone (a re-run, or
  // two reapers racing). Historically it could ALSO lock nothing when RLS
  // filtered the row out — before #5023 wave 05, `DELETE /devices/:id/permanent`
  // ran this whole cascade under the CALLER's tenant-scoped request context,
  // and at least one table it touches (abuse_endpoint_fingerprints, see the
  // note below) is deliberately invisible under that policy. That branch no
  // longer applies: every caller of this function — the single-device route,
  // the bulk-purge worker's `purgeOne` (jobs/deviceBulkPurge.ts, always
  // system-scoped), and the Quick Support reaper — now runs it inside a
  // SYSTEM db context, so the devices row here is fully visible whenever it
  // exists. The re-run/racing-reaper case above is the only remaining reason
  // for a zero-row lock; the RLS-visibility hazard survives only as history.
  // If a future caller ever invokes this from a tenant-scoped context again,
  // the OLD child-first-ordering race this lock exists to close comes back.
  //
  // Deleting an absent device is legitimately idempotent, so a zero-row result
  // must NOT abort — two reapers racing would then error instead of one simply
  // finding nothing. Report it instead, so an unserialized cascade is visible
  // rather than silently assumed safe.
  //
  // Bound the wait, then put it back.
  //
  // `set_config(..., true)` is transaction-local, NOT statement-local: Postgres
  // applies lock_timeout to every subsequent lock acquisition until the
  // transaction ends. Both callers already run inside an outer transaction
  // (withDbAccessContext opens one — db/index.ts), and a nested
  // `db.transaction()` is only a SAVEPOINT, whose release does NOT undo a
  // SET LOCAL. So without an explicit restore this 3s bound would silently
  // govern every child DELETE below, the route's link-group dissolution, and —
  // in the reaper, which wraps its whole pass in one context — every device
  // purged after this one. Capture the caller's value and restore it as soon as
  // the row lock is held; the lock itself survives to transaction end, so the
  // timeout does not need to stay in force.
  // Tighten the lock bound and read the caller's prior value in ONE statement,
  // entirely in SQL.
  //
  // `pg_settings.setting` for `lock_timeout` is a plain INTEGER of milliseconds
  // (verified on Postgres 16: `0`, `250`, `7000`, always with unit `ms`),
  // unlike `current_setting`, which renders `250ms` / `3s` / `2min` and has to
  // be unit-parsed on the client. Doing the comparison here removes that parser
  // and, more importantly, removes the failure mode it created: an earlier
  // revision decided whether to bound the lock based on a value it had to
  // decode first, so an unreadable result meant choosing between aborting the
  // delete outright and proceeding on an UNBOUNDED wait that pins a pooled
  // connection. This statement always leaves the timeout bounded, so neither
  // branch can arise. (That "abort" horn used to be worse still, because the
  // route dispatched SELF_UNINSTALL before this transaction — #3817 moved the
  // dispatch after the commit, so nothing irreversible has happened by the
  // time this runs, for either caller.)
  //
  // `ms = 0` is Postgres's "disable the timeout", i.e. infinitely loose, so it
  // is always worth tightening. A caller already stricter than the bound keeps
  // its own value — this must never WIDEN a stricter caller, since SET LOCAL
