/**
 * Report email delivery (#4248 W03).
 *
 * `emailReportRun` and `emailReportFailure` were moved here VERBATIM from
 * `jobs/reportScheduleWorker.ts` so the weekly AI org narrative (which the
 * report worker deliberately never executes -- see WORKER_EXCLUDED_REPORT_TYPES)
 * can reuse the exact same rendering from its own delivery path. Their
 * rendering is pinned by `reportDelivery.snapshot.test.ts`, taken before the
 * move: any change to what they produce must be a deliberate snapshot update.
 *
 * Shape to keep in mind downstream: both take EMAIL ADDRESS STRINGS (not user
 * ids) and IDENTIFIERS THE CALLER ALREADY RESOLVED (`partnerId`), build
 * in-memory PDF/CSV buffers, and touch no db handle. That last property is why
 * `partnerId` is a parameter rather than a lookup: the partner-lane sender
 * (spec §8.2) needs it, and this module must not grow a query to get it.
