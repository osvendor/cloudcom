/**
 * Tenant Cascade Service (Task 30 — GDPR org-wide erasure)
 *
 * Provides the authoritative list of `org_id`-scoped public tables, plus
 * a `cascadeDeleteOrg(orgId, performedBy)` helper that walks every such
 * table and removes the org's rows in FK-safe order.
 *
 * The list is authoritative. A contract test
 * (`__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts`) cross-
 * checks `getOrgCascadeDeleteOrder()` against `information_schema.columns`
 * and the documented `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` allowlist mirror — a new
 * `org_id`-columned table that isn't in the cascade list will fail CI.
 *
 * FK-safe deletion strategy:
 *   We do NOT trust a hand-maintained topo order; FKs change.
 *   Instead, at delete time we query `pg_constraint` for the FK graph
 *   amongst the listed tables and topologically sort children-first.
 *   Tables outside the org-cascade set that hold FK references *into*
 *   the set (rare; e.g. `device_commands`) are handled by their own
 *   explicit pre-clear step in the same transaction.
 *
 * Auth/RLS:
 *   Cascade runs under `withSystemDbAccessContext`. The caller is
 *   already gated by platformAdmin + MFA at the route layer; the
 *   service does not re-check authorization — but it DOES require
 *   an explicit `performedBy` user id for the audit trail.
 *
 * audit_logs special-casing:
 *   - `audit_logs` is in the cascade list (it has an `org_id` column).
 *   - `breeze_app` cannot DELETE from `audit_logs` (Task 29 trigger);
 *     the cascade runs `SET LOCAL ROLE breeze_audit_admin` +
 *     `SET LOCAL breeze.allow_audit_retention = '1'` for that one table.
 *   - The `tenant.erasure` audit event itself is written with
 *     `org_id = NULL` BEFORE the cascade so it survives the cascade.
 *
 * The cascade is destructive and unrecoverable beyond Postgres PITR.

  // no FK and no org_id column — so the table is correctly absent from
  // CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER, no FK breaks without this, and nothing in CI
  // could ever have flagged it. What it strands is exactly what erasure exists
  // to remove: the erased org's UUID paired with the QuickBooks Customer id it
  // was billed under, retained indefinitely under the partner.
  //
  // It also poisons the live integration. `listMappingProposals` builds
  // `claimedRemoteIds` from every mapping row for the connection, so an orphan
  // row keeps a real QuickBooks Customer permanently filtered out of the
  // candidate pool for every surviving org, and a manual confirm of that
  // customer 409s forever on `accounting_entity_mappings_remote_uniq` — with
  // no UI anywhere that can show or clear the offending row, because its org
  // no longer exists.
  //
  // Only the 'org' rows are keyed by an organization id; 'catalog_item' rows
  // are partner-scoped and must survive. Phase C added 'invoice'/'payment'
  // rows, which are keyed by an invoice/invoice_payments row that DOES carry
  // org_id — but since accounting_entity_mappings itself has no org_id column
  // (and no FK), reaching them still needs an explicit join through those
  // tables, done here BEFORE the main cascade loop (this whole
  // ASSOCIATED_SYSTEM_SCOPED_TABLES pass runs in step 1b of cascadeDeleteOrg,
  // ahead of the CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER walk that deletes
  // invoices/invoice_payments themselves) so the subqueries below still see
  // the rows they need to join through.
  //
  // ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not a gap: a 'payment' row with
  // `pending_op = 'delete'` is the OUTBOX of a QuickBooks deletion Breeze still
  // owes (Phase D2). Breeze created that Payment in the partner's books and
  // deleting the mapping discards the debt silently, leaving real money
  // recorded against an org that no longer exists — and nothing can recreate
  // the row, because the `accounting_entity_mappings_entity_partner_guard`
  // trigger refuses an INSERT whose `invoice_payments` row is gone. The row is
  // retained instead, and the count is logged. It holds no org-scoped personal
  // data (a remote id, a SyncToken, a status) and it is bounded in time:
  // `deletePaymentInAccounting` deletes it once QuickBooks confirms, or drops
  // it loudly after PAYMENT_DELETE_UNRESOLVED_GRACE_MS.

 *
 * Strategy (mirrors cascadeDeleteOrg):
 *   1. For each child org -> cascadeDeleteOrg (also removes the organizations row).
 *   2. FK-safe sweep of every public table with a `partner_id` column, deleting
 *      this partner's rows children-first. One DELETE per call so a single FK

 *   3. Delete the partners row last.
 *
 * Returns the ACTUAL number of rows deleted per table (via `extractRowCount`),
 * not the count of tables attempted — so a purge that silently matched zero
 * rows (e.g. a future contextless-write regression under forced RLS, #1375)
 * is visible as `totalRowsDeleted === 0` rather than masquerading as success.
 *
 * Audit trail: a `purge_started` row is written BEFORE any delete (org_id=NULL,
 * so it survives the cascade); a `purged` completion row after. On a mid-sweep
 * failure a best-effort `purge_failed` row records how far the sweep got before
 * the error is rethrown — a destructive op must never abort without a forensic
 * record. Both the completion and failure audit writes are best-effort: the
 * partner is already (partly) deleted, so an audit hiccup must not change the
 * outcome the caller sees.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running on an already-purged partner matches zero rows.
