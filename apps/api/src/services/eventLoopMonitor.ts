/**
 * Event-loop lag instrumentation (#3022).
 *
 * Why this exists: the API is a single-threaded Node process, so every timer it
 * arms is really a promise about *scheduling*, not about elapsed wall-clock
 * work. postgres.js arms `connect_timeout` with a plain `setTimeout`
 * (`connection.js:1042-1054`, started in `connect()` and cancelled only on
 * ReadyForQuery), which means the 10s budget covers socket create → TCP → SSL →
 * auth → ReadyForQuery *and* every socket callback in between. When the main
 * thread is pegged, none of those callbacks get scheduled and the driver reports
 * `write CONNECT_TIMEOUT <host>:<port>` — a connection fault that never
 * happened. The database and the network are healthy the whole time.
 *
 * That misattribution is the expensive part: the incident in #3022 presented as
 * three unrelated Sentry signatures (CONNECT_TIMEOUT, a `nextWrite` TypeError
 * from the teardown race, and a patch-scheduler sweep failure) with no way to
 * tell from telemetry alone that they were one starvation event. This module
 * makes the loop's own health a first-class, queryable signal so the next
 * occurrence is diagnosable from metrics instead of by hand.
 *
 * Measurement source is `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay`, a libuv-level timer
 * that records the delta between when it was due and when it actually ran. It
 * keeps accumulating while JS is blocked, so a 12s stall shows up as a ~12s
 * `max` on the first tick after the loop frees up. Overhead is a native
 * histogram update every `resolution` ms — negligible next to request work.
 *
 * NOTE ON DELIBERATE NON-GOALS: this module measures and reports. It does not
 * raise `connect_timeout` (per #3022 that lengthens the failing request without
 * fixing anything) and it does not retry, shed load, or otherwise change request
 * behaviour. Reducing the per-request main-thread work that causes the stall is
 * separate work.
