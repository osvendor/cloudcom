/**
 * MCP registration coverage guard (#2605).
 *
 * The in-product technician chat attaches exactly ONE MCP server — the one
 * built by `createBreezeMcpServer` — and the model only ever sees the tools
 * declared there via `tool(name, description, shape, handler)`. Being present in
 * the `aiTools` execution registry, in `TOOL_PERMISSIONS`, in `toolInputSchemas`
 * and in `TOOL_TIERS` is NOT enough: `BREEZE_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` is derived from
 * `TOOL_TIERS`, so an unregistered tool is silently allowlisted as
 * `mcp__breeze__<name>` while no such tool exists. The model cannot call it and
 * cannot report that it is missing — it just picks a neighbouring tool.
 *
 * That is exactly how #2605 happened: the three BE-16 vulnerability tools were
 * wired everywhere except `createBreezeMcpServer`, so every CVE question got
 * answered out of `get_security_posture` / `manage_patches`. No test failed.
 *
 * These tests read the real source (never a hardcoded copy of the tool list) so
 * the next missed registration fails here instead of shipping as "the model
 * never picks that tool".
