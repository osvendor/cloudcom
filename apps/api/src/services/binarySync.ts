// `safeFetch` calls `assertOutsideHeldDbContext`. Previously, both call sites
// in this module ran INSIDE a held DB access context:
//   - boot: index.ts wrapped syncBinaries() in runWithSystemDbAccess
//     → withSystemDbAccessContext → withDbAccessContext (a real transaction),
//     holding a pooled connection idle-in-transaction for the whole boot-time
//     network phase (verified: 2.7s hold, tripwire fired x10 — #6098);
//   - route: POST /agent-versions/sync-github took the withDbAccessContext
//     branch in middleware/auth.ts (same hazard, one request at a time).
//
// The fix does NOT wrap these fetches in runOutsideDbContext — that would only
// swap the AsyncLocalStorage `db` pointer; the caller's `baseDb.transaction()`
// promise is still awaiting this function's return, so the pooled connection
// stays pinned idle-in-transaction regardless. Instead:
//   - every DB access this module makes (the four `db.transaction` writes and
//     the one `db.select` read) opens its OWN short `withSystemDbAccessContext`
//     around just that access, so this module never NEEDS an ambient context;
//   - the boot call site (index.ts) no longer wraps `syncBinaries()` in any
//     context at all;
//   - `POST /agent-versions/sync-github` is registered in
//     `SELF_MANAGED_DB_CONTEXT_ROUTES` so `authMiddleware` doesn't open one
//     either.
// CAUTION for the next caller: `withSystemDbAccessContext` reuses whatever
// ambient context is ALREADY open rather than nesting (`withDbAccessContext`
// early-returns on any live store — it does not check the store is
// system-scoped). So a future caller that wraps one of these functions in its
// OWN context — even a narrower one — makes the write silently run at that
// caller's scope instead of escalating to system, and re-pins a pooled
// connection across the network round-trip, reintroducing the #6098 hazard
// this file fixes. Neither live caller does this today (both boot and
// POST /agent-versions/sync-github are contextless), but don't add one that
// does; see persistAuditLog's `runOutsideDbContext` pairing in
// services/auditService.ts for the pattern that actually forces escalation.
