/**
 * The AI Operator recovery scans (#5205 W06), spec §6.3.
 *
 * "A reconciler queries live task dependencies and authoritative source rows
 * after missed/duplicate/out-of-order delivery, recovering with the same
 * stable wakeup identity." Four sets, and the reason there are exactly four is
 * that they are the four ways a task can stop making progress:
 *
 *  1. QUEUED PAST ITS ADMISSION WAKE — admitted but never picked up.
 *  2. WAITING PAST `next_wake_at` — its event wake was lost (Redis down, a
 *     publisher crash, a consumer that failed after acknowledging).
 *  3. RUNNING PAST `lease_expires_at` — the coordinator holding it died.
 *  4. TERMINAL WITH AN UNSETTLED OPERATION — the task closed while a device
 *     command was still outstanding. Spec §6.3: "task closure cannot hide a
 *     late result."
 *
 * IT RE-DERIVES FROM SOURCE ROWS, NEVER FROM THE OUTBOX. The outbox is a
 * delivery mechanism; an unpublished row proves only that a message was not
 * sent, not what the truth is. Sets 1-3 re-enter `advanceTask`, which reads
 * the operation, the intent and the device command itself. Set 4 reads the
 * operation and the device command directly.
 *
 * IT NEVER RESTARTS A MUTATION. Set 4 can only settle an operation or hand the
 * task off with `unknown_effect`; there is no branch anywhere in this file that
 * dispatches anything. Spec §6.5: "an effect with lost acknowledgement,
 * timeout, or unknown result requires authoritative reconciliation; if its
 * absence cannot be proved and the provider lacks idempotency, hand off."
 *
 * IT KEEPS RUNNING WHEN THE FEATURE IS OFF. `aiOperatorTasksEnabled()` gates
 * ADMISSION (in `taskService.ts` and `admitReasoningRun`), not this file —
 * spec §11.2 is explicit that the kill switches "fence new admissions and
 * dispatch claims" while "the publisher and reconciler keep running so late
 * results still land". Disabling the feature must never abandon a restart
 * command that is already on a device.
