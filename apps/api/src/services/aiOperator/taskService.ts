/**
 * AI Operator task admission and inspection (#5205 W06), spec §5.1, §7.1.
 *
 * INTERNAL API ONLY. There is deliberately no HTTP route here: W07 shipped the
 * read routes and W08 owns the POST admission surface. Everything in this file
 * is called by the coordinator, the recipe, or a test.
 *
 * WHAT ADMISSION FREEZES (spec §7.1: "Admission pins agent identity, task
 * origin, target scope, workflow version, and an effective authorization
 * ceiling"). The frozen values live in NOT NULL columns on the task row rather
 * than only inside the checkpoint jsonb, for two reasons: a later policy
 * change must not be able to rewrite what the task was reviewed as, and every
 * frozen value that a customer must be able to export has to live in a bounded
 * `text` column (spec §11 — every jsonb column is `excludedOpen`).
 *
 *  - `agent_id` + `agent_kind` + `agent_name`: the agent as it was. A
 *    replacement same-kind agent cannot inherit the task (enforced again at
 *    every run admission, in `runService.ts`).
 *  - `workflow_key` + `workflow_version`: the recipe as released.
 *  - `device_id` + `target_label`: the target, plus a frozen display label that
 *    survives the device being moved or deleted.
 *  - `deadline_at`: NOT NULL by contract, because `dispatchClaim.ts`'s
 *    `evaluateTaskClaimPredicate` FAILS CLOSED on a null deadline ("absence of
 *    a bound is not permission"). A task admitted without one could never
 *    dispatch anything.
 *  - `checkpoint`: the recipe input and the criterion, both parsed.
