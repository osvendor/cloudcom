/**
 * The AI Operator task coordinator (#5205 W06), spec §6.2 and §6.3.
 *
 * This is the only process that advances `ai_operator_tasks`. It does three
 * things and nothing else: take a lease, advance one step, release.
 *
 * THREE INVARIANTS, each of which is a bug this design is built to avoid:
 *
 *  1. IT HOLDS NOTHING WHILE WAITING. No SDK process, no DB connection, no
 *     queue worker survives a `waiting` transition (spec §6.2). Every wait
 *     writes `next_wake_at` and returns. It also never calls a model to check
 *     a timestamp (spec §7.2) — every wake decision here is made from rows.
 *
 *  2. IT NEVER TRUSTS THE WAKE PAYLOAD. A wake job carries `{orgId, taskId,
 *     sourceKind, sourceId, transitionSeq}` and that is a REFERENCE, not
 *     data. Every decision re-reads the authoritative row: the operation's
 *     `result_state`, the intent's status, the device command through the
 *     authorized adapter. That is what makes duplicate and out-of-order wakes
 *     converge instead of diverging (spec §6.3), and it is why the publisher
 *     deliberately puts no payload on the wire.
 *
 *  3. `revision` IS THE PLAN REVISION, NOT A CAS COUNTER (quorum finding,
 *     2026-09-08, independently confirmed by Codex). The shipped dispatch
 *     claim refuses a dispatch whose `plan_revision` no longer matches the
 *     task's `revision`. If taking a lease bumped `revision`, then any
 *     approval decided while the coordinator happened to tick would become
 *     permanently undispatchable — which is acceptance scenario 3 itself, the
 *     "approve after the browser closed" path this whole wave exists to make
 *     work. So the lease CAS GUARDS on `revision` and never increments it.
 *     Optimistic concurrency is `lease_epoch`. `revision` moves only in
 *     `bumpPlanRevision`, when a genuinely new plan is admitted, and moving it
 *     there is the point: it invalidates the previous plan's stale approval.
 *
 * LEASE VS ATTEMPT. Reclaiming a lease advances `lease_epoch` ONLY. It never
 * advances `attempt_ordinal`, which moves only when an explicit next reasoning
 * attempt is admitted (spec §6.2). And results produced by operations a
 * SUPERSEDED epoch dispatched are accepted under their original identity
 * (spec §6.3) — this module never rejects a result for carrying an old epoch,
 * only new ADMISSIONS are epoch-fenced.
 *
 * RECIPE RESOLUTION (Recipe Library spec §6.1). Every bound, prompt version,
 * step table and permitted-next-step table this file reads comes from the
 * RecipeDefinition resolved from the task's own frozen `(workflow_key,
 * workflow_version)`, never from an imported constant. What a step DOES is
 * still this file's job — spec §6.1's step-kind table assigns execution to the
 * coordinator and data to the recipe — so the per-recipe advancer table below
 * lives here and not in `recipes/`. A task whose pair the registry cannot
 * resolve HANDS OFF; it never throws, because a throw would leave its wake job
 * retrying against a row that can never advance.
