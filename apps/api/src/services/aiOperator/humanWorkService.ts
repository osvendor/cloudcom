// AI Operator human-work steps (Recipe Library wave E3, spec §5.3 and §6.5).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: a `human_work` step is the one step kind whose
// completion is written by someone OUTSIDE the Operator — a technician ticking
// a checklist item on a ticket. That makes it the only place the Operator's
// object graph and the ticket system touch, and it deserves exactly one writer
// so the two sides can never drift about which row owns the link, which org
// each row is in, or what happens when they stop agreeing.
//
// THE OPERATOR CREATES ITEMS AND NEVER COMPLETES THEM (spec §6.5). There is no
// `done_at` write anywhere in this file, and `humanWorkPurity.test.ts` scans
// the whole `services/aiOperator/` tree to keep it that way. Completion is a
// human attestation on a compliance artifact; an agent that could tick its own
// checklist would be grading its own homework.
//
// ATOMICITY. Every write takes the caller's handle (`dbh`), exactly like
// `enqueueTaskOutbox` (taskOutbox.ts), `appendTaskEvent` (eventService.ts)
// and `openStep` (stepService.ts). The request path is already one Postgres
// transaction (`withDbAccessContext`, db/index.ts) and the bare `db` proxy
// joins it, so `patchChecklistItem`'s guarded `done_at` UPDATE and the wake
// this file enqueues commit together or not at all. NO `db.transaction()` is
// opened here.
//
// IMPORT DIRECTION IS ONE-WAY: `ticketChecklistService` imports THIS module,
// never the reverse. That is why the checklist-item insert below is written
// against the Drizzle table directly instead of calling `addChecklistItem` —
// which also hardcodes `source: 'manual'` and stamps `createdBy: actor.userId`,
// neither of which is right for an Operator-created row.
//
// THE LINK IS DETACHED, NEVER RE-STAMPED. `ticket_checklist_items.org_id` moves
// with its ticket; `ai_operator_task_steps.org_id` is immutable task history.
// When they diverge, `detachHumanWorkLinksForTicket` nulls the pointer and
// wakes the task, and the coordinator's authoritative re-read turns that into a
// classified handoff. See migration 2026-10-26-170100's header note A.

 *  - `addAiTriageNote` DOES accept a null user id, but it is keyed on an
 *    `ai_agent_runs.id` and is idempotent per run
 *    (`ticket_comments_one_ai_note_per_run_uq`), so a second reminder for the

 *
 * ONE TRANSACTION FOR THE WHOLE PASS. `withSystemDbAccessContext` runs its
 * callback inside a single Postgres transaction, so the stamps, comments and
 * notifications for every row in the batch commit or roll back TOGETHER: a
 * throw on row N undoes rows 1..N-1 as well, and the next tick retries the
 * whole batch cleanly. There is no per-row isolation, and none is needed.
 *
 * Within that transaction, `reminded_at` is stamped by a GUARDED update
 * (`WHERE reminded_at IS NULL`) before the side-effects. That guard is what
 * makes two API pods ticking concurrently safe: both may SELECT the same
 * overdue row, but the second pod's UPDATE waits on the row lock, sees the
 * stamp once the first commits, matches nothing, and skips the comment.
 *
 * The system context is also what `createNotification` requires
 * (`runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(...))`); the inner
 * helper is a passthrough under an ambient context, so the wrapper here
