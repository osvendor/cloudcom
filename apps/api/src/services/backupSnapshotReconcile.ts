/**
 * Orphaned-snapshot reconciliation (#3006).
 *
 * A backup run uploads `snapshots/<id>/manifest.json` plus `files/...` to the
 * customer's destination and only then sends its terminal result. When that
 * result is lost in transit (#3001 oversized IPC payload, #2998 helper death)
 * the job row never learns the snapshot ID, so nothing links the uploaded
 * objects to a restore point: the data is complete and paid-for but
 * unreachable through the product, and — because retention only ever looks at
 * `backup_snapshots` rows — it is neither restorable nor reaped.
 *
 * This service enumerates a destination's manifest-bearing snapshot prefixes
 * and adopts the unclaimed ones into `backup_snapshots` rows, which makes them
 * restorable AND visible to both retention phases (row-level expiry and the
 * mark-and-sweep object GC).
 *
 * TENANCY. The destination is a customer-owned bucket that Breeze does not
 * partition by org — the agent writes `snapshots/<id>/...` verbatim with no
 * org or device prefix (see the KNOWN GAP note in backupSnapshotStorage.ts).
 * Enumerating it is therefore a cross-tenant read risk whenever two orgs point
 * their `backup_configs` at the same physical bucket. Four defences, in
 * order of strength:
 *
 *  1. The caller may only name a `configId` their OWN org owns (checked below
 *     against `backup_configs.org_id`), so they can never point reconcile at
 *     another tenant's destination.
 *  2. Adoption requires an existing `backup_jobs` row in the caller's org —
 *     `backup_snapshots.job_id` and `.device_id` are NOT NULL, so there is no
 *     way to manufacture a restore point without one. Claims are resolved in a
 *     SYSTEM db context precisely so a row owned by ANOTHER org is VISIBLE and
 *     can be refused; under the caller's own RLS context it would look
 *     unclaimed and get stolen. ANY foreign claim refuses the snapshot, even
 *     when one of our own jobs claims it too (see `foreignClaimed`).
 *  3. The claiming job must target THIS destination, so a restore point is
 *     never stamped with a config whose bucket does not hold the objects.
 *  4. If the destination's storage identity is shared with any other org's
 *     config, the weaker time-window matcher is disabled entirely — only exact
 *     `backup_jobs.snapshot_id` matches (which are unambiguous) are adopted.
 *     Sharing is tested on both `normalizeStorageIdentity` AND a cruder
 *     provider+bucket key, because the former only canonicalises the default
 *     AWS endpoint (see `coarseStorageIdentity`).

/**
 * Job statuses a storage snapshot may be adopted into via an EXACT

 *
 * `completed` is included for one narrow, self-healing reason: adoption is not
 * atomic (`applyBackupCommandResultToJob` commits the job UPDATE before
 * inserting `backup_snapshots`), so a crash in between leaves a `completed`
 * job carrying a snapshot id with NO restore point — the #3006 failure mode
 * recurring inside its own fix, and unreachable forever if reconcile refused
 * to look at it again. A `completed` job is only ever treated as adoptable
 * when the snapshot has no `backup_snapshots` row at all (see the candidate
 * loop), which is precisely that half-written state; the write itself is an
 * upsert keyed on (jobId, snapshotId), so re-running is idempotent.
