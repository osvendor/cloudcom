/**
 * The AI Operator merge fence's human-work arm (Recipe Library wave E3).
 *
 * Org merge re-points the loser org's tickets — and therefore its checklist
 * items — at the survivor, while task and step `org_id` stay on the loser.
 * The link FK is plain and single-column, so nothing raises; the fence has to
 * null the pointer itself, in the RESOLVE phase, or a fenced task carries a
 * cross-tenant pointer for as long as it exists. Asserted from the compiled
 * SQL so a later edit cannot quietly drop the org or the settled_at guard.
