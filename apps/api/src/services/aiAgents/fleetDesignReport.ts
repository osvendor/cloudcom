/**
 * Fleet Designer W01 (#5651), Task 8 — turns the `FleetDesignOutcome` a
 * `design`-profile run produced (`runLoop.ts`'s `finalizeFleetDesign`) into a
 * durable, downloadable REPORT: one system-authored `reports` definition per
 * ORGANIZATION plus one `report_runs` artifact per run, with
 * `ai_agent_runs.report_run_id` linking the run to it.
 *
 * Direct sibling of `narrativeReport.ts` (`persistNarrativeReport`) — read
 * that module's header for the shared DB-context posture (one system
 * transaction, the run-lock-then-CAS pattern, hand-pinned `org_id` on every
 * statement). Two things are structurally different here:
 *
 *  1. **The definition is keyed on the ORG, not the schedule.** A narrative
 *     definition is one per `source_ai_agent_schedule_id` because every
 *     narrative run is scheduled. A Fleet Design has no such guarantee —
 *     `POST /ai/fleet-design/runs` starts a manual, schedule-less run — so
 *     the definition is upserted against the PARTIAL unique index
 *     `reports_ai_fleet_design_org_uniq` (`org_id`) `WHERE type =
 *     'ai_fleet_design'` (migration `2026-10-16-170500-ai-agents-fleet-designer.sql`)
 *     instead. A later run — manual or scheduled — reuses the SAME
 *     definition row and simply replaces its artifact, exactly like a human
 *     re-running any other one-time report.
 *  2. **`schedule: 'one_time'`, not `'weekly'`.** The definition's own
 *     `schedule` column governs whether `reportScheduleWorker.ts` would try
 *     to poll it for a next occurrence; a Fleet Design is never polled (its
 *     occurrences come from the AGENT scheduler, exactly like narrative) so
 *     the exclusion is enforced the same way (`WORKER_EXCLUDED_REPORT_TYPES`),
 *     but `'one_time'` is also just the true shape here: unlike narrative,
 *     the schedule that produced a GIVEN run is not part of the definition's
 *     own identity.
 *
 * ## What reaches the stored snapshot
 *
 * `report_runs.result.summary.fleetDesign` is a `FleetDesignReportSummary`:
 * the server-built `FleetDesignOutcome` (every `itemRef` attached,
 * `baseline.numbers` computed, markdown derived) verbatim, plus provenance
 * scalars. The bounded `DesignEvidence` bundle itself is NEVER stored — only
 * `evidenceTruncated` and `devicesNotAssessed`, same "the evidence was
 * assembled to be rendered into ONE prompt, not persisted" posture
 * `narrativeReport.ts` documents for `NarrativeContext`.
