/**
 * Which `AiAgentLimits` field is enforced where. Every field must appear in
 * this list — an unenforced cap is an unbounded agent (self-review item 3).
 *
 *  - maxConcurrentRuns     — HERE (admission rule 6)
 *  - maxRunsPerHour        — HERE (admission rule 6)
 *  - maxBudgetCentsPerDay  — HERE (admission rule 7), per agent per org
 *  - cooldownSeconds       — HERE (admission rule 5), policy root not `limits`
 *  - maxTurnsPerRun        — run loop (`aiAgentRunner`, Task 4)
 *  - maxBudgetCentsPerRun  — run loop (SDK `maxBudgetUsd`)
 *  - wallClockSeconds      — run loop (abort controller)
 *  - maxDevicesPerRun      — DEFERRED: wave 3 creates single-device runs only
 *                            (`CreateAgentRunInput.deviceId` is one id, not a
 *                            list), so there is nothing to cap yet. Enforce it
 *                            when fleet-wide runs land.
 *  - maxFleetPercentPerDay — DEFERRED to wave 5 (fleet remediation): needs a
 *                            per-day distinct-device count against org fleet
 *                            size, which only means something once an agent can
 *                            touch more than one device.
 *  - maxActionsPerRun      — DEFERRED to Part B (#3826): the field ships in
 *                            wave 4a so partners can pre-configure it and
 *                            snapshots carry it; Part B's run loop is what
 *                            enforces it.
 *  - maxPolicyDecisionsPerDay — DEFERRED to wave 5 Part B (#3827): the field
 *                            ships in this PR (wave 5 Part A) so partners can
 *                            pre-configure it and every snapshot from now on
 *                            carries it; `resolvePolicyDecisionState` is a
 *                            stub that always returns `human_required`, so
 *                            nothing consumes the cap yet — Part B's
 *                            `attemptPolicyDecision` is the enforcer.
 *  - maxConsecutiveFailures — agentCircuit.ts via transitionRunStatus (wave 6
 *                            PR 2, #3828): the field ships in this task so
 *                            partners can pre-configure it and every
 *                            snapshot from now on carries it; the circuit
 *                            breaker itself (recordRunTerminal, the
 *                            terminalization chokepoint) is a later task in

 *  - maxVerdictRunsPerHour — HERE (admission rule 6b), verdict-profile runs

 *                            verdict volume can never starve full-profile runs.
 *  - maxConcurrentVerdictRuns — HERE (admission rule 6b), verdict-profile runs
 *                            only — counted separately from maxConcurrentRuns.
 *  - verdictBudgetCentsPerRun — run loop (verdictLimits(), verdictProfile.ts):

 *                            verdict-profile run; not enforced here.

 *                            from maxRunsPerHour/maxVerdictRunsPerHour so
 *                            scheduled-sweep volume can never starve either.
 *  - maxConcurrentSweepRuns — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),
 *                            sweep-profile runs only — counted separately
 *                            from maxConcurrentRuns/maxConcurrentVerdictRuns.

 *  - sweepMaxTurns         — run loop (sweepLimits(), sweepProfile.ts):

 *                            run; not enforced here.
 *  - maxConcurrentNarrativeRuns — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),

 *                            from maxConcurrentRuns/maxConcurrentVerdictRuns/
 *                            maxConcurrentSweepRuns (phase 2 P2-3).
 *  - maxNarrativeRunsPerHour — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),
 *                            narrative-profile runs only — counted separately
 *                            from every other per-hour cap, so the weekly
 *                            narrative can never starve sweeps or verdicts
 *                            (or be starved by them).
 *  - narrativeBudgetCentsPerRun — run loop (narrativeLimits(),
 *                            narrativeProfile.ts): substitutes for
 *                            maxBudgetCentsPerRun on a narrative-profile run;

 *  - narrativeMaxTurns     — run loop (narrativeLimits(),

 *                            triage-profile runs only — counted separately
 *                            from every other per-run-shape concurrency cap

 *                            verdicts or narratives.
 *  - triageBudgetCentsPerRun — run loop (triageLimits(), triageProfile.ts):

 *                            above (Fleet Designer W01).
 *  - maxDesignRunsPerDay   — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),
 *                            design-profile runs only, over a 24-HOUR window
 *                            rather than the hourly window every other
 *                            profile uses (`caps.windowMs`) — a design run is
 *                            a scheduled-at-most-monthly, expensive-relative-
 *                            to-a-sweep report, so an hourly rate cap would
 *                            be meaningless; a daily one bounds manual-trigger
 *                            abuse without needing its own bespoke plumbing.
 *  - designBudgetCentsPerRun — run loop (designLimits(), designProfile.ts):

 *  - maxConcurrentPatchRuns — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),

 *  - maxPatchRunsPerDay    — HERE (admission rule 6b, via profileCaps()),
 *                            patch-profile runs only, over the same 24-HOUR
 *                            window as design: a patch run is once a day per
 *                            org plus the occasional manual "Run now".
 *  - patchBudgetCentsPerRun — run loop (patchLimits(), patchProfile.ts):

 *  - maxUnattendedDevicesPerSweep — persistSweepFindings' readiness-cohort
 *                            walk (sweepActCohort.ts, #4442 W05): bounds how

 *                            mint act-eligible. Merged with min.
 *  - sweepPromoteThreshold — graduationService.evaluateEligibility (#4442
 *                            W05): an extra bar, on top of promoteThreshold,
 *                            over verified evidence from SWEEP-minted

  // Circuit-breaker bookkeeping (wave 6 PR 2, #3828). This is the ONE place a
  // run's status becomes terminal (`reapStalledAgentRuns` and
  // `failRunAfterEnqueueFailure` route through here too, see above), so this
  // is the ONE call site for `recordRunTerminal` — see the terminalization
  // contract test (`runService.terminalization.contract.test.ts`), which
  // asserts nothing else in the codebase writes a terminal status onto
  // `ai_agent_runs` directly.
  //
  // Deliberately OUTSIDE the `inSystemDbContext` block above, and wrapped in
  // its own try/catch: a circuit-accounting statement failure must never be
  // able to poison (and therefore roll back at COMMIT time) the run's own
  // terminal-status write — see `agentCircuit.ts`'s `recordRunTerminal`
  // docstring for the exact Postgres trap this avoids (the same one
  // `createAndEnqueueAgentRun`'s dedupe-key reclaim comment documents for a
  // caught 23505). In every call site that reaches an ambient context with no
  // system scope already active (runLoop.ts's every call; this function's own
  // `failRunAfterEnqueueFailure`), the update above has genuinely already
  // committed on its own connection by the time this runs. The one exception
  // — `reapStalledAgentRuns` called from inside admission's own already-open
  // system context — nests into that SAME uncommitted transaction instead,
  // but is safe by construction: its only errorCode ('stalled') always
  // classifies `neutral` (agentCircuit.ts), so `recordRunTerminal` returns
  // before issuing any SQL at all in that path.
  // Execution plane W04 (#5715) — release an outstanding compute reservation
  // on EVERY terminal transition, in the same chokepoint the circuit
  // bookkeeping uses and for the same reason: the two hand-picked release
  // sites (the run loop's `finalizeWorkspaceForRun`, admission's
  // enqueue-failure path) only cover runs that got that far. A worker killed
  // mid-run, or a run stopped at the pre-start policy gate, reaches a terminal
  // status through `reapStalledAgentRuns` / `transitionRunStatus` alone — and
  // left its reservation standing, which (a) counts against the org's daily
  // compute ceiling until UTC midnight, refusing that org's later analyses
  // with `compute_budget_exceeded`, and (b) never bills the compute the
  // provider really did run.
  //
  // Settled at the RESERVATION, not at zero: spec §9's "usage unavailable ⇒
  // settle at the reservation, never $0" — a run we lost track of is exactly
  // the case where the measured number is gone. A normally finished run has
  // already settled (which NULLs the column), so this is a no-op for it, and
  // `settleComputeCents` is idempotent against a cleared reservation.
