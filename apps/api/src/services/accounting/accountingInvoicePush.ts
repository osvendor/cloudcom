/**
 * The ONE sanctioned entry to `AccountingProvider.pushInvoice`/`voidInvoice`
 * (Phase C, Task 3 — .superpowers/sdd/2026-09-01-quickbooks-phase-c-invoice-push/
 * task-3-brief.md; contract comment: accountingCurrency.ts:143-186).
 *
 * `pushInvoiceToAccounting` / `voidInvoiceInAccounting` own connection/token
 * resolution, the currency guard (assertAccountingInvoicePushCurrency, run
 * BEFORE any network call), org/catalog-item dependency sync, and every write
 * to the invoice's `accounting_entity_mappings` row. Nothing else in the repo
 * may call `provider.pushInvoice`/`voidInvoice` directly —
 * `accountingInvoicePushCallSites.test.ts` enforces that with an AST scan of
 * `apps/api/src` + `ee`.
 *
 * Mirrors `accountingMappingService.ts`'s failure taxonomy
 * (sanitizeSyncErrorMessage / markMappingError / persistRemoteRef's
 * zero-row-throw / upsertMappingRow's unique-violation handling) but
 * reimplements each locally against the invoice row: that module's helpers are
 * shaped for the org/catalog-item entity workbench (Task 4) and don't carry
 * the invoice-specific fields (docNumber, tax variance) this coordinator needs.
 *
 * DB ACCESS CONTRACT (review round 3 — #1105 / lost-sync-state class). This
 * coordinator MUST be entered with NO ambient DB access context (asserted) and
 * takes a `runInDbContext` runner instead: routes pass
 * `(fn) => withAuthDbAccessContext(auth, fn)`, the worker passes
 * `(fn) => withSystemDbAccessContext(fn, 'accountingSync.<type>')`. Every DB
 * phase is one SHORT invocation of that runner, i.e. a real transaction that
 * commits on its own, and no context is ever open across a QuickBooks call:
 *
 *   Phase 1  connection (no token), invoice, currency guard, org/item mappings
 *   ─ dependency syncs (each self-contained, own phases) ─
 *   Phase 1b pending invoice-mapping upsert                        [COMMITS]
 *   ─ token resolution, then the QBO push/void — nothing held ─
 *   Phase 2  persistInvoiceRemoteRef, or markInvoiceMappingError   [COMMITS]
 *
 * The split is load-bearing, not hygiene. Held inside ONE caller-opened
 * transaction (the previous shape), `markInvoiceMappingError` and the pending
 * mapping row were savepoints that rolled back the instant this coordinator
 * threw: the operator saw no error at all, and the retry took the CREATE path
 * again and double-booked the invoice in QuickBooks.
 *
 * The currency guard inside Phase 1 is the SAME trap in miniature (#4498): it
 * throws from inside that one transaction, so a write made in that same
 * callback would roll back with it. `persistInvoiceCurrencyMismatchErrorInOwnContext`
 * therefore runs from the OUTER catch around Phase 1 — AFTER Phase 1's
 * transaction has already rolled back — in its own short, separately-committed
 * context, exactly like `markInvoiceMappingErrorInOwnContext` does for Phase 2.
