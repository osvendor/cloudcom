/**
 * Wave 6 PR 4 (#3828) Task 2 — after the three per-row detectors above have
 * run for this org/range, collapse the `metric_anomalies` rows they just
 * touched into their canonical `metric_anomaly_incidents` row(s).
 *
 * Collapsing key matches `metric_anomaly_incidents`' unique index exactly:
 * `(org_id, device_id, anomaly_type, bucket_seconds, window_start)` —
 * `metric_name` deliberately excluded from GROUP BY and the conflict target,
 * mirroring `metricAnomalyPromotion.ts`'s `findDedupeSiblings` (it still
 * appears folded into `array_agg(DISTINCT metric_name)`, listing every
 * sibling metric name the incident collapses).
 *
 * Filtered on `ma.window_end >= $1`, NOT `ma.window_start` — a growth-trend
 * row's `window_start` is the START of its multi-bucket trend window and can
 * predate this pass's `from` (the trend CTE looks up to `MIN_TREND_BUCKETS`
 * buckets before its anchor), so filtering on `window_start >= from` would
 * exclude every growth-trend row whose anchor lands in the first
 * `MIN_TREND_BUCKETS * RAW_BUCKET_SECONDS` of the range — which, given the
 * cron's `to - from` spacing, is every anchor except the single bucket
 * nearest `to`. `window_end` (`last_bucket_start + RAW_BUCKET_SECONDS` for
 * growth trends, always `bucket_start + RAW_BUCKET_SECONDS` for the other
 * two detectors) is always `>= from` for any row this pass just wrote, since
 * every detector's own bucket-selection CTE already requires
 * `bucket_start >= from`. There is deliberately no upper bound against `to`:
 * an incident can keep collapsing across later revisit passes rather than
 * falling out of range once its window_end ages past a subsequent pass's
 * `from`.
 *
 * `metric_anomalies.window_start`/`detected_at` are naive `timestamp` (no
 * tz) — always written in UTC by the rollup pipeline (see the detectors
 * above). `metric_anomaly_incidents`'s corresponding columns are
 * `timestamptz`. `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` converts explicitly rather than
 * relying on an implicit cast, which would reinterpret the naive value using
 * the session's `TimeZone` setting — silently wrong were that setting ever
 * not UTC.
 *
 * See `incidentUpsertAssignments()` above for why `dispatched_at` /
 * `dispatch_attempts` / `agent_run_id` never appear in this statement at
 * all — not in the INSERT column list, not in SELECT, not in the ON
 * CONFLICT SET list. That is the re-publish guard.
 *
 * `episode_id` is the episode of the highest-score member (the `episodes`
 * stage runs first, A6); the publisher (W02) dispatches at most one incident
 * per episode.

 * before the next stage starts), and reporting that as a benign `locked` would
