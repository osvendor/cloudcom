export const MCP_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are connected to Breeze RMM — a multi-tenant Remote Monitoring and Management platform for MSPs. This server exposes ~${MCP_TOOL_COUNT_APPROX} tools for managing devices, alerts, patches, backups, security, tickets, and configuration policies.

## Tenant hierarchy
Partner (MSP) → Organization (customer) → Site (location) → Device Group → Device. You can only see and act within the organizations your API key/token grants access to.

## How to choose among the tools
1. Resolve context first: use resolve_device_context or query_devices to find the exact device/org before acting.
2. Read before write: prefer query_* and get_* tools to understand state before any manage_* or execute_* call.
3. One target at a time unless the user explicitly asks for a fleet-wide operation.

## Common workflows
For frequent MSP tasks, use the guided prompts: breeze-fleet-triage, breeze-device-investigate, breeze-patch-remediate, breeze-incident-kickoff, breeze-turnkey-setup.`;

2. Scan for missing patches: manage_patches (action=scan, deviceIds required), then read action=list for the resolved deviceId and present the gaps.
3. STOP and ask the user to explicitly CONFIRM before applying — installing patches is a destructive, approval-gated (Tier-3) operation.
4. Only after explicit confirmation, approve the selected patches: manage_patches (action=approve, patchId or patchName; use ringId for a specific update ring). Omit ringId only for an explicitly confirmed partner-wide blanket approval. Approval changes eligibility; it does not install patches.
5. Install the approved selection: manage_patches (action=install) requires BOTH patchIds and deviceIds. Never patch beyond the confirmed target.

    render: (a) => `Set up a recommended baseline configuration in Breeze RMM${a.scope ? ` for ${a.scope}` : ''}. DEFAULT to partner-wide ownership (ownerScope=partner) so one policy applies to all of the MSP's organizations — ECHO the resolved organization/partner scope back to the user, CONFIRM the ownerScope=partner default, and PREVIEW each policy before applying it.

Before authoring settings, call manage_policy_feature_link (action=describe, featureType) — no existing policy ID is needed. For a link-only feature, create the standalone policy first (manage_software_policies or manage_peripheral_policies), then link its returned UUID as featurePolicyId. Create patch rings with manage_update_rings before linking their IDs. For backup, create the selection profile with manage_backup_profiles and use its ID as featurePolicyId; create storage with manage_backup_configs and put its ID in inlineSettings.destinationConfigId. Backup cadence and retention use nested inlineSettings.schedule and inlineSettings.retention. A partner-owned configuration policy applies to no organizations until assigned.

Walk through these categories, creating each via a Configuration Policy (manage_configuration_policy) with the appropriate prerequisite policy + feature link (manage_policy_feature_link), then assign with apply_configuration_policy:
1. Patch rings/cadence (manage_update_rings): pilot ring patches on release; production ring 7-day deferral; security/critical auto-approve at 3-day deferral; feature updates deferred 30 days; reboots in an off-hours maintenance window.
2. Backup SLA (manage_backup_profiles and manage_backup_configs): daily backup, RPO 24h, retention 30 days, alert if no successful backup in 48h.
3. DNS security (manage_dns_policy): enable filtering; block malware/phishing/C2/newly-registered-domain categories.
4. Peripheral policy (manage_peripheral_policies): block unauthorized USB mass-storage by default; allow HID.
5. Config/CIS baseline: apply CIS Level 1 baseline for the device OS via the policy's security/compliance feature (inlineSettings).
6. Core alert rules via the policy's alert_rule feature (inlineSettings): device offline > 15 min; disk > 90%; sustained CPU > 95% for 10 min; failed backup; critical patch missing > 7 days; reliability-score drop.

These are recommended defaults — let the user adjust values before applying. Never assign a policy without confirming the target scope.`,
