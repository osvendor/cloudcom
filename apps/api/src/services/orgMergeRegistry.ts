/**
 * Org-merge policy registry (org-lifecycle Wave 2, Task 1).
 *
 * Every table in `getOrgCascadeDeleteOrder()` (plus a handful of no-org_id
 * tables that a merge must still account for — see EXTRA_REQUIRED in the
 * contract test) needs exactly one merge policy. The contract test
 * (`orgMergeRegistry.integration.test.ts`) enforces completeness: it fails
 * loudly if a table is missing a policy, or if a policy names a table that
 * isn't actually in scope.
 *
 * This registry does not execute anything — it only classifies. The merge
 * engine (Task 2) and the hand-written executors (Task 3, `orgMerge.ts`
 * CUSTOM_EXECUTORS) consume it.
 *
 * Key/keyWhere literals use `{col}` placeholders for column references
 * inside expressions (`lower({name})`, `{source_ref} IS NOT NULL`) — the
 * Task-2 builders substitute the table alias. A bare string with no braces
 * is a plain column name.

// pre-clear entry there with `deleteSoftwareCatalogsAndObjects` (it now also
// has to delete the version's uploaded S3 artifact, which a bare DELETE
// statement can't do), so it dropped out of that list. Its merge tenancy

// Every remaining cascade table: a plain org_id repoint, no dedup needed.

// pasted in verbatim below. `users` (email globally unique — a person's one
// row simply moves) and `portal_users` (no email unique — nothing can
// collide) are deliberately here rather than in SPECIAL, per the brief.
// Same for vendor-mapping integration tables (huntress_org_mappings,
// s1_org_mappings, unifi_site_mappings, organization_external_links, etc.):
// they carry no org-scoped unique key, so after the merge the survivor simply
// holds BOTH orgs' mappings and there is nothing to dedupe or drop.
//
// CORRECTED (final review): an earlier version of this comment claimed the
// duplicates "surface in the merge summary". They do not, and the summary has
// no mechanism that could — it is keyed by table and carries only moved/dropped
// counts, so two mappings landing under one org are indistinguishable from two
// unrelated rows moving. `organization_external_links` is the ONE exception,
// and only because `collectDuplicates` (orgMerge.ts) runs an explicit
// `GROUP BY system HAVING count(*) > 1` for it; the huntress/s1/unifi mapping
// tables get no such pass and their duplicates are silent by design — a
// re-import may bind to either row.
