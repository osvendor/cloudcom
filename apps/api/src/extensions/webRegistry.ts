/**
 * The pure projection from "what's active" to the browser-safe document
 * `GET /api/v1/extensions/registry` serves (see routes/extensionsWeb.ts for
 * the live enabled-recheck and digest lookup that produce the input array).
 *
 * BROWSER-SAFE ONLY. This module is the one place that decides which fields
 * of an extension's manifest/state are allowed to reach a browser. Anything
 * NOT explicitly copied into `RuntimeWebExtension` below — the extraction
 * root, artifact URI, trust/publisher key material, `requires`, `server`,
 * `tenancy`, `migrationsDir`, `publicRoutes`, `agentRoutes` — is never
 * touched by this function, so a future manifest field added upstream cannot
 * silently leak here; it has to be deliberately added to the projection.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Every replica in the fleet runs this independently against its
 * own in-memory registry snapshot. Two replicas that agree on WHICH
 * extensions are active must produce byte-identical JSON (and therefore the
 * same `revision`), so a client polling through a load balancer never sees
 * the document "change" for no reason. That means: sort extensions by name,
 * sort each extension's pages/navigation/slots by their manifest-declared
 * `id` (falling back to another schema-unique field when `id` is omitted —
 * the manifest schema allows that), and serialize with a fixed, explicit key
 * order (never rely on `Object.keys` insertion order of a spread).
 *
 * `moduleUrl` now embeds a short-lived signed asset token (issue #4164 — a
 * bare dynamic `import()` cannot send an Authorization header, so the
 * capability has to travel in the URL). That does NOT break determinism:
 * `mintExtensionAssetToken` snaps its `iat` to a coarse time bucket, so every
 * replica minting for the same extension + digest + tenant in the same bucket
 * emits the same bytes. The revision therefore stays stable within a bucket
 * and changes at each rollover — which is exactly the signal the browser
 * client needs to adopt freshly-credentialled URLs, and is why the token is
 * hashed INTO the revision rather than excluded from it. (Excluding it would
 * let the client's revision-keyed memo hand back a document whose token has
 * since expired.) The revision does vary per tenant scope, but a given client
 * is always one tenant, so no client sees it flap.
