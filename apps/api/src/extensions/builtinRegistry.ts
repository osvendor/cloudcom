 * imports it transitively at module scope, so an eager read made
 * `ee/workspace/manifest.json` a hard boot requirement for EVERY deployment,
 * including one that had opted out via `BREEZE_WORKSPACE_ENABLED`. Laziness is
 * what lets a slimmed image that omits a disabled built-in's files boot; the
 * ENABLED path resolves the manifest immediately and still fails hard.

 *   - success → every later access returns the SAME manifest object.
 *   - failure → every later access rethrows the IDENTICAL error instance, so a
 *     retrying caller cannot hammer the disk and the operator sees one stable
 *     diagnostic instead of a different one per attempt.
 *
 * A cached failure is NOT retried for the lifetime of the process, deliberately:
 * the manifest ships inside the image, so it cannot legitimately appear after
 * boot, and a per-access retry would turn one diagnosable failure into a
 * stuttering series of them. The remedy for a fixed image is a restart.
 *
 * Resolution also enforces `manifest.name === spec.name`. The static name is
 * the identity the disabled path uses when the manifest is unavailable
 * (skipDisabledBuiltin), so a silent disagreement between the registry entry
 * and the shipped manifest would let the two paths talk about different
