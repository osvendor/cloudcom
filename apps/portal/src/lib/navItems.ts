/**
 * Nav entries for the portal shell, honoring per-org feature toggles from the
 * branding payload (#2345, #4562). Order matters: a portal customer comes to
 * approve a proposal or pay a bill, so those lead once Dashboard (opt-in) is
 * out of the way.
 *
 * "Proposals", not "Quotes": every page this leads to is titled Proposal, and
 * a customer does not connect the two labels.
 *
 * Fail-open flags (existing behavior, unchanged): Tickets and Devices stay
 * visible unless explicitly disabled (Devices also has an opt-in visibility
 * flag) — the API column defaults to true /
 * self-service defaults on, and the server-side 403 gate on the underlying
 * routes is the real enforcement.
 *
 * Fail-closed flags (new, #4562): Dashboard, Security, Backups, Reports, and
 * Equipment (asset checkout) only earn a slot once explicitly turned on. A
 * missing branding row or an undefined flag hides them — this is new surface
 * area with no legacy "always on" expectation to preserve, unlike Tickets.
 * Equipment stays fail-closed for the reason it always was: the assets route
 * reads the same `devices` table as `/devices` minus a column, so without
 * checkout it is a second nav word for the same machines.
