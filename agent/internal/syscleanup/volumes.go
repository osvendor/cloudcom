// Device (issue #6483): a btrfs host commonly exposes one subvolume per bind
// mount under the SAME block device — an OrbStack Ubuntu VM observed 228 of
// them — and every one measures identical free space. Reporting each as a
// distinct volume both wastes syscalls and can blow past the API's fixed
// volume-count cap, turning the whole cleanup catalog into a 502. A partition
// with no Device (some virtual/synthetic mounts) is never deduped against
