// allowlisted ones it did not select:
//
//   - `/sagerun:5555` executes every handler whose StateFlags5555 is 2,
//     wherever that value came from. A third-party cleanup handler, an OEM
//     one, or an excluded built-in (DownloadsFolder) that already carries a 2
//     — set by another tool, by a prior Breeze run, or by a user who once ran
//     `cleanmgr /sageset:5555` — would run alongside the selection with no
//     trace in the result. The allowlist constrains what Breeze may SELECT; it
//     cannot constrain what the shared profile already says.
//   - Any write failure aborts BEFORE cleanmgr starts. A half-written profile
//     is worse than no run: it executes an arbitrary subset that matches
//     neither what the tech chose nor what the result will claim.
//   - Nothing is restored afterwards. Profile 5555 is Breeze-owned by
//     convention, the next run rewrites it wholesale, and "restoring" a
//     profile another tool may have edited concurrently would be a second
//     guess at state we do not own.
//
// HKLM\SOFTWARE\...\VolumeCaches is trusted as admin-only: a caller who can
// write there can already run cleanmgr directly. Handler key names are treated
// as LABELS, not as authenticity — the allowlist is a list of things Breeze
// offers, not proof that a key of that name is the Microsoft handler.
//
// Session-0 caveat (spec §7.2, measured in W05 and fixed in #6482): under the
// SYSTEM account cleanmgr renders a progress UI onto session 0's invisible
// desktop and never exits — 3 of 3 lab runs sat at ~0.2 s of CPU for the whole
// 60-minute cap with the file work already done. The runner therefore waits on
// the whole process tree (the job object in process_tree_windows.go), treats
// the exit code as INFORMATIONAL ONLY, and arms the idle watchdog
// (cleanmgrIdleLimits): once the tree's CPU total has been flat for five
// minutes it is terminated and the run reports `completed` with
// cleanmgrIdleNote, because a cleanmgr that has stopped working has finished
// its handlers. The 60-minute cap stays as the backstop for hosts where the
// job object could not be created, and that path still reports timed_out.
//
// Whatever the outcome, cleanmgr reports NOTHING per handler, so every
// sub-action carries the parent's status rather than a `completed` nobody
// verified (W05 BUG-3). The acceptance criterion for this action is the lab
// run, not a unit test — nothing here can prove session-0 behaviour.
