// --- session-0 idle watchdog (#6482) ---------------------------------------
//
// cleanmgr.exe /sagerun under the SYSTEM service runs its handlers and then
// never exits: it renders a progress UI onto session 0's invisible desktop and
// waits for a dismissal that can never arrive. The W05 lab reproduced this
// 3 times out of 3 — the tree sat at ~0.2 s of CPU for the entire 60-minute
// cap, with the file work already done. Waiting for that cap turns every Disk
// Cleanup run into an hour and reports `timed_out` for work that finished in
// seconds.
//
// The distinguishing signal is the process TREE's CPU accounting: a cleaner
// that is still deleting files keeps accruing kernel time, a wedged one does
// not move at all. idleTracker is the pure decision half, so the rule is
// exercised by `go test ./internal/syscleanup/...` on the Linux CI runner,
// where the Windows job-object plumbing cannot run.

// default for every cleaner except cleanmgr.
