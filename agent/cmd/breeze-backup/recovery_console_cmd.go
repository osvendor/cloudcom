// recoveryConsoleLockPath is a well-known path under /run (tmpfs on the
// recovery media, cleared on every real reboot) — see
// recoveryconsole.Deps.AcquireLock's doc comment for why this lock exists
// at all: breeze-recovery.service (tty1) and the serial-getty@ttyS0
// override BOTH unconditionally start on every boot, so without mutual
// exclusion two console instances would independently partition/format/
// mount the same target disk concurrently in breeze.ci=1 mode. A var (not
// a const) so tests can point it at a scratch file instead of the real
// /run path.
var recoveryConsoleLockPath = "/run/breeze-recovery-console.lock"

// recoveryConsoleLockPollInterval is a var so nothing about this needs to
// be faster in tests — the console package's own unit tests exercise
// AcquireLock via a fake, never this real implementation.
var recoveryConsoleLockPollInterval = 2 * time.Second

// acquireRecoveryConsoleLock blocks until it is the only holder of
// recoveryConsoleLockPath, using O_EXCL as the mutual-exclusion primitive
// (portable, no new dependency — a real flock(2) wrapper would be no more
// robust for two same-host processes racing a create, and simpler to
// reason about for the one-shot "acquire once at startup, release once at
// exit" pattern this needs). The winner stamps its own PID into the lock
// file.
//
// A bare O_EXCL lock (the original W04b implementation) has a real
// failure mode found in code review: if the holder is SIGKILLed or
// OOM-killed, its deferred release never runs, and systemd's
// Restart=always brings the SAME unit right back up — which then blocks
// on its OWN abandoned lock file forever, with no output, because nothing
// on the media ever removes a stale lock. To recover from that: on
// EEXIST, read the recorded holder PID and treat the lock as stale
// (remove it and retry the create once) when that PID is no longer alive,
// or when the file can't be read/parsed at all — the latter covers a
// holder SIGKILLed between O_CREATE and writing its own PID, which is
// exactly as likely as being killed after. A lock recording a genuinely
// live PID is left alone; the caller blocks, polling, printing the
// waiting message below exactly once. Either way the loser (a losing
// stale-reclaim race, or a real live lock) exits cleanly on ctx
// cancellation rather than hanging — there is no scenario where the loser
// needs to do anything else once the winner reboots/powers off the whole
// machine.

// That two-step version (this function's original W04b review revision)
// had a real race, found on PR #5588's own CI run: os.OpenFile(O_CREATE|
// O_EXCL) makes the path exist immediately, but this process's PID isn't
// written into it until the very next line — under the QEMU e2e's real
// (TCG-emulated, so much slower and less predictable than bare metal)
// scheduling, that window was wide enough for the OTHER console instance
// to os.OpenFile the same path, get EEXIST, read an EMPTY file, conclude
// — correctly, per the stale-reclaim logic this whole mechanism exists for
// — that looks exactly like a holder SIGKILLed between O_CREATE and
// writing its PID, and reclaim a lock the winner was still legitimately
// creating. Result: both instances believed they held the lock, and
// progress.json showed the exact duplicated-phase signature (two
// consoles racing) AcquireLock exists to prevent in the first place.
//
// os.Link only succeeds if recoveryConsoleLockPath does NOT already
// exist (same EEXIST-on-conflict semantics as the O_CREATE|O_EXCL this
// replaces), but by the time it's called the temp file already holds
// complete content — so no other process can ever observe the path
// existing with anything but a valid, complete PID. A leftover temp file
