/**
 * THE canonical list of report types (#3198 spec §6). `reportTypeSchema`
 * (apps/api/src/routes/reports/schemas.ts), the API `ReportType` union
 * (apps/api/src/services/reportGenerationService.ts) and the web union
 * (apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportsList.tsx) all derive from this
 * tuple.
 *
 * The ONE place that still hand-lists the values is the Drizzle pgEnum
 * `reportTypeEnum` (apps/api/src/db/schema/reports.ts) — a pgEnum's value
 * order is a shipped database fact, so it cannot be spread from a tuple that
 * a later author might reorder. `reportGenerationService.test.ts` asserts the
 * two agree.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: this is `report_type` enum order. Append new types
 * at the end; never reorder.
