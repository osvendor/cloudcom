 * operation reserves its `ai_operator_operations` row and from which the
 * intent's `idempotency_key` is derived, so accepting it from an HTTP body
 * would let a caller (a) mint an intent that a task it does not own is then
 * obliged to reconcile, and (b) choose the single ON CONFLICT arbiter's key
 * material directly. Every HTTP intent surface must therefore build its
 * `CreateActionIntentInput` WITHOUT this field; the coordinator (W06) is the
 * only producer.
 *
 * The schema exists so that the one internal seam that does construct it
 * validates shape and bounds at the boundary rather than trusting a
 * hand-built object literal. The `max()` bounds mirror the CHECK constraints
 * on `ai_operator_operations.task_step_key` (128) and `.operation_key` (200)
 * declared in 2026-10-14-100000-ai-operator-thin-slice.sql, so an over-long
 * key is a typed rejection at the seam instead of a 23514 mid-transaction.
