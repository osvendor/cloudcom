// Canonical permission registry — the single source of truth for resource:action

// (permission-aware nav/action gating) type their permission references against
// the same closed set. The API re-exports this as `PERMISSIONS` from
// `services/permissions.ts`; the web derives `PermissionGrant`/`PermissionResource`/
// `PermissionAction` for its gate literals.
//
