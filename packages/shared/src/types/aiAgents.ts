 * Bumped whenever the shape of `effective` changes. ai_agent_runs.policy_snapshot
 * is append-only ledger data that outlives this type, so a v1 row must stay
 * distinguishable from a v2 row — there is no backfill for a run that already
 * happened.
 *
 * v2: `effective.limits` gained `maxActionsPerRun`. An in-flight run enqueued
 * before that deploy still carries a v1 snapshot (no `maxActionsPerRun` in
 * `effective.limits`) and MUST still execute — every read site that touches
 * `schemaVersion` or `effective.limits` has to tolerate a v1 row, never
 * reject it.
 *
 * v3 (wave 5 Part A #3827): `effective.limits` gained
 * `maxPolicyDecisionsPerDay`. Same rule: an in-flight run's v1 or v2 snapshot
 * lacks the field and MUST still execute — nothing reads it yet (unenforced
 * this PR), but every site that switches on `schemaVersion` must tolerate
 * 1, 2, AND 3.
 *
 * v4 (wave 6 PR 2 #3828): `effective.limits` gained
 * `maxConsecutiveFailures` (the circuit breaker's threshold). Same rule
 * again: a v1/v2/v3 in-flight run's snapshot lacks the field and MUST still
 * execute — `recordRunTerminal` (agentCircuit.ts) resolves the effective
 * threshold at transition time via `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem`, never off
 * the stored run snapshot, so a pre-v4 run's missing field never blocks
 * circuit accounting. Every site that switches on `schemaVersion` must
 * tolerate 1, 2, 3, AND 4. Write side always stamps the current version.
 *
 * v5 (phase 2 P2-1): `effective.limits` gained
 * `maxVerdictRunsPerHour`, `maxConcurrentVerdictRuns`,
 * `verdictBudgetCentsPerRun`; read sites fall back to
 * `AI_AGENT_LIMIT_DEFAULTS` for a v1–v4 snapshot. `verdictBudgetCentsPerRun`'s
 * default (and `VERDICT_MAX_TURNS` in verdictProfile.ts) were tuned from
 * 2¢/3 turns to 5¢/4 turns shortly after this bump, after the P2-1 live
 * check (task 16) found 3 of 4 Sonnet verdict runs ran out before submitting
 * — the schema shape didn't change again, so this is still a v5 snapshot.
 *
 * v6 (this bump, P2-2): sweep-profile counters/budget/turns —
 * `effective.limits` gained `maxConcurrentSweepRuns`, `maxSweepRunsPerHour`,
 * `sweepBudgetCentsPerRun`, `sweepMaxTurns`. Same rule as every prior bump:

 *

/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-1 (alert verdicts). `full` is the existing (default) agent
 * run shape; `verdict` is a lighter-weight run profile scoped to producing
 * an `AiAlertVerdict` for one alert or correlation group instead of a full
 * triage/patch/helpdesk turn. See runService step 6b for how admission is
 * counted per-profile.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-2 (scheduled sweeps) added `sweep`: a `schedule`-triggered
 * run profile that evaluates a fixed set of `AiSweepKind`s against one org's
 * fleet and produces a `SweepFindingsOutcome` instead of a full triage turn.
 * Admission for `sweep`-profile runs is counted against
 * `AiAgentLimits.maxConcurrentSweepRuns`/`maxSweepRunsPerHour`, not the
 * `full`/`verdict` counters above — see that field's docstring.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-3 (weekly org narrative) added `narrative`: a
 * `schedule`-triggered run profile that reads one org's bounded weekly
 * context and produces a `NarrativeOutcome` (see `orgNarrativeReport.ts`)
 * instead of findings or a verdict. Admission is counted against
 * `AiAgentLimits.maxConcurrentNarrativeRuns`/`maxNarrativeRunsPerHour`.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-4 (ticket triage, act) added `triage`: a
 * `ticket`-triggered run profile (create / first human comment /
 * `status_changed → resolved`) with an empty tool floor plus
 * `submit_ticket_proposal` as its only outcome tool — a `full`-profile run
 * cannot reach an outcome tool. Produces a `TicketTriageProposal`
 * (`types/ticketTriage.ts`) instead of findings, a verdict, or a narrative.
 * Admission is counted against
 * `AiAgentLimits.maxConcurrentTriageRuns`/`maxTriageRunsPerHour`.
 *
 * AI patch agent (W01) added `patch`: a device-less, `schedule`- or
 * manually-triggered run profile driven only by a `patch`-kind agent. It
 * reads a system-assembled patch evidence bundle and produces a
 * `PatchPlanOutcome` (`types/aiPatchPlan.ts`) through its one outcome tool,
 * `submit_patch_plan`. It executes nothing (`maxActionsPerRun` pinned to 0).
 * Admission is counted against
 * `AiAgentLimits.maxConcurrentPatchRuns`/`maxPatchRunsPerDay`.
 *
 * Execution plane W04 (spec 2026-09-13) added `analysis`: a hosted-only,
 * device-LESS run over a frozen device SET (`ai_agent_runs.staged_inputs`)
 * that gathers server-side datasets, computes inside a per-run sandbox via
 * the `workspace_*` tools, and ends with `submit_analysis`. Admission is
 * counted against `analysisMaxConcurrentRuns`/`analysisMaxRunsPerHour`.
