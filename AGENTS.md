# Breeze RMM - Codex Context

## Project Overview

Breeze is a fast, modern Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform for MSPs and internal IT teams. Target: 10,000+ agents with enterprise features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro + React Islands
- **API**: Hono (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Queue**: BullMQ + Redis
- **Agent**: Go (cross-platform)
- **Real-time**: HTTP polling + WebSocket
- **Remote Access**: WebRTC

## Key Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Hierarchy
```
Partner (MSP) → Organization (Customer) → Site (Location) → Device Group → Device
```

### Tenant Isolation / RLS (READ BEFORE ADDING TABLES)
API connects to Postgres as unprivileged `breeze_app`. Every tenant-scoped table MUST have RLS enabled + forced + policies — no app-layer-only fallback. Contract test: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`.

**Six tenancy shapes:**

| # | Shape | Policy helper | Allowlist |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direct `org_id` column | `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)` | auto-discovered |
| 2 | Id-keyed (`organizations`) | `breeze_has_org_access(id)` | `ORG_ID_KEYED_TENANT_TABLES` |
| 3 | Partner-axis | `breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id)` (flat, never tree traversal) | `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` |
| 4 | Dual-axis (`users`) | partner OR org OR `breeze_current_user_id()`; enforced by composite FK `(org_id, partner_id) → organizations(id, partner_id)` | — |
| 5 | Device-id scoped | hot agent-write tables denormalize `org_id` (Phase 1-4); cold tables use `EXISTS` join policy (Phase 5) | `DEVICE_ID_JOIN_POLICY_TABLES` |
| 6 | User-id scoped | `breeze_current_user_id()` | `USER_ID_SCOPED_TABLES` |

**DB context helpers** (`apps/api/src/db/index.ts`): `withDbAccessContext` (request path), `withSystemDbAccessContext` (background/seeds — call `runOutsideDbContext` first if inside a request), bare pool is forbidden in request code.

**Intentionally system-scoped:** `device_commands` (agent WS path). Anything else flagged `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` in a plan doc.

**Workflow for a new tenant-scoped table:**
1. Pick a shape; add policies in the same migration that creates the table — never defer.
2. Migration must be idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS` / `DO $$`). Never edit a shipped migration.
3. Add to the relevant allowlist in `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` in the same PR (shapes 2-6).
4. Run the contract test locally (needs real DB).
5. Verify as `breeze_app`: `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze` and forge a cross-tenant insert — must fail with `new row violates row-level security policy`.

For production backfills of `org_id` on hot tables (>1M rows), batch via `UPDATE ... WHERE ctid IN (... LIMIT N)` loops before `SET NOT NULL`. Full narrative and rationale: `docs/superpowers/plans/tenancy-rls/2026-04-11-rls-coverage-gaps.md`.

### Database Schema Location
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/` - All Drizzle schema definitions
- Key tables: devices, users, organizations, sites, alerts, scripts, automations

### API Routes
- `apps/api/src/routes/` - Hono route handlers
- Pattern: Export `xxxRoutes` from each file, mount in `index.ts`

### File Size Guideline
- **Aim to keep files under 500 lines** as a soft guideline, not a hard rule. Use judgment — if a file is cohesive and readable at 600 lines, that's fine. Split when a file becomes hard to navigate or mixes unrelated concerns, not just because it crossed a line count.
- **Declarative files** (e.g. `aiTools*.ts`, schema definitions) can naturally run longer since they're mostly self-contained registration blocks.
- Follow the `aiTools*.ts` pattern: one thin hub file for registry/exports, per-domain files for implementations (e.g. `aiToolsDevice.ts`, `aiToolsNetwork.ts`).
- For route files, split by resource. For service files, split by domain. Helpers used by multiple files can be duplicated locally or extracted to a shared utils file.
- **Do not proactively split files** that are working well just to meet a line count target. Only split when it improves clarity or maintainability.

### Context Preservation
- **Prefer subagents (Agent tool) for research, exploration, and isolated tasks** to keep the main conversation context lean and avoid hitting context limits during long sessions.
- Use subagents for: codebase searches, file reading/analysis, PR reviews, build log inspection, and any work that produces large output.
- Keep the main context for: decision-making, coordinating work, and user interaction.

### URL State in Components
- Use `window.location.hash` (`#value`) for client-side UI state like selected tabs, selected items in lists, etc. See `DeviceDetails.tsx` and `OrganizationsPage.tsx` for examples.
- Do **not** use query params (`?key=value`) for transient UI state — keep the pattern consistent.

### No Internal Infrastructure Details in Public Code
- **Never commit** IP addresses, server hostnames, datacenter regions, droplet IPs, or internal domain mappings to the public repo.
- Region-specific values belong in `.env` files (gitignored), not in code or config templates.
- `.env.example` files should use generic placeholders (`host`, `password`, `your-domain.example.com`), not real values.
- The `internal/` directory is gitignored and safe for strategy docs, internal notes, and infra-specific details.

### Shared Code
- `packages/shared/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `packages/shared/src/validators/` - Zod schemas
- `packages/shared/src/utils/` - Utility functions

### Web Mutation Handlers — `runAction`

**Mutation handlers must surface outcome via `runAction`.** Web action handlers that POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE should wrap the request in `runAction` (`apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`) so success/failure is always shown to the user. `runAction` also treats HTTP-200 `{success:false}` / `{testResult:{success:false}}` response bodies as failures (not silent no-ops).

Catch pattern for callers:
```ts
if (err instanceof ActionError && err.status === 401) return; // let auth redirect handle it
if (!(err instanceof ActionError)) showToast({ type: 'error', ... }); // non-401 ActionError already toasted by runAction
```

The `no-silent-mutations` test (`apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts`) guards the adopted set. Legitimate exceptions (typed service layers, aggregate/partial-success handlers with inline error UI) are recorded in `apps/web/src/lib/runActionAllowlist.ts`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/web-ui/2026-05-15-ws-a-action-feedback-design.md`.

## Testing Standards

### Frameworks & Configuration
- **API**: Vitest — `apps/api/vitest.config.ts` (unit), `vitest.config.rls.ts` (RLS), `vitest.integration.config.ts` (integration)
- **Web**: Vitest + jsdom — `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
- **Agent**: Go standard `testing` package — `go test -race ./...`
- **Shared**: Vitest — `packages/shared/vitest.config.ts`
- **E2E**: Playwright Test (TypeScript), `data-testid` based — `e2e-tests/playwright.config.ts`, specs under `e2e-tests/tests/*.spec.ts`, Page Objects under `e2e-tests/pages/`. Tests query DOM via `data-testid` attributes only (not text/role/CSS) — see `e2e-tests/README.md` for the convention.

### Test File Placement
- Place test files **alongside source files**, not in separate directories
- API: `routes/devices.ts` → `routes/devices.test.ts`
- Go: `internal/discovery/scanner.go` → `internal/discovery/scanner_test.go`
- Shared: `validators/filters.ts` → `validators/filters.test.ts`

### Writing API Route Tests (Vitest)
- Mock Drizzle ORM query chains matching the exact chain pattern in the source (e.g., `select().from().where()`)
- Always test **multi-tenant isolation** — verify org-scoped data can't be accessed cross-org
- Test all HTTP methods, auth/authz, Zod validation failures, not-found, and error cases
- Use proper UUIDs in mock data — Zod validates UUID format and will reject `'other-org'`
- Avoid trailing slashes in test URLs — Hono sub-routers return 404 for trailing slashes
- `vi.mock` factories are hoisted — don't reference module-level `const` values inside them; use literal values instead
- Read 2-3 existing test files in the same directory before writing new ones to match patterns

### Writing Go Agent Tests
- Use **table-driven tests** for functions with multiple input/output combinations
- Always run with `-race` flag to catch data races
- Mock external dependencies (network, OS, filesystem) — never make real network calls
- Use build tags for platform-specific tests: `//go:build !windows` or `//go:build darwin`
- Test nil/empty inputs, error paths, and concurrency safety (spawn goroutines in tests)
- Place test helpers in the same package, not in a separate `_test` package

### Writing Shared Validator Tests
- Test valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary values, and Zod defaults/coercion
- For discriminated unions, test each variant separately
- Test `omitempty`/optional fields with both present and absent values
- For schemas with `superRefine`, test all validation branches

### What Every New Feature Must Test
1. **Happy path** — basic success case
2. **Auth/authz** — unauthenticated, wrong role, wrong org
3. **Validation** — missing required fields, invalid types, boundary values
4. **Multi-tenant isolation** — cross-org access denied
5. **Error cases** — not found, conflict, server error
6. **Edge cases** — empty arrays, nil inputs, concurrent access

### CI Integration
- The inherited Breeze workflows have been removed at the user's request; CloudCom CI and a controlled upstream-release updater are implemented; see the CI guide for current coverage and deployment boundaries.
- Follow `docs/cloudcom-ci.md`: validate our changes and affected interfaces against a pinned released upstream baseline.
- Do not restore the upstream full pipeline during merges or claim automated coverage beyond the actual implemented checks.
- Application tests remain available; inherited workflow-file contracts need adaptation for the replacement pipeline.

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
pnpm test

# API only
pnpm test --filter=@breeze/api

# Go agent (with race detection)
cd agent && go test -race ./...

# Specific Go package
cd agent && go test -race ./internal/discovery/...

# E2E
cd e2e-tests && pnpm test
```

## CloudCom Fork Maintenance

Read `docs/cloudcom-upstream-maintenance.md` before changing fork behavior or integrating upstream updates. Update its change register in the same PR as each CloudCom customization, including affected files, compatibility boundaries, tests, and migration/recovery implications. Distinguish planned work from implemented and verified work. Never treat a conflict-free merge or previous CI results as proof that a new upstream integration is safe.

## CloudCom Codex Delegation Policy

This policy governs Codex delegation for this project and takes precedence over the older `Codex Delegation` section below wherever they conflict. The primary Codex agent is the coordinator: it owns task scope, decisions, integration, and the final result.

- Delegate narrow, routine UI or documentation work to `gpt-5.6-luna` at low reasoning effort.
- Delegate ordinary, bounded implementation work to `gpt-5.6-terra` at medium reasoning effort.
- Keep architecture, security, client/tenant isolation, migrations, and final critical review with the primary agent.
- Give delegated agents only the context and files needed for their bounded task. Prefer scripts and CI for deterministic, repeatable work.
- Do not change global settings as part of project delegation. Do not claim token or cost savings without measurements.

## Legacy Codex Delegation Notes

This project uses OpenAI Codex CLI for task delegation. Claude orchestrates complex work while Codex handles isolated tasks.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Standard task
codex exec "<task>" --full-auto -C "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# With reasoning level (low/medium/high/xhigh)
codex exec "<task>" --full-auto -c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"'

# Resume previous session
codex exec resume --last "<follow-up>"
```

### Delegation Guidelines

#### Delegate to Codex
| Task | Reasoning | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| File operations | low | "Find all files importing X" |
| Utility functions | medium | "Create a slugify utility" |
| CRUD endpoints | medium | "Add DELETE /api/devices/:id" |
| Test generation | medium | "Write tests for formatBytes" |
| Lint/type fixes | medium | "Fix TypeScript errors in auth.ts" |
| Code analysis | high | "Review this for security issues" |
| Architecture | xhigh | "Design the caching strategy" |

#### Keep with Claude
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Cross-module refactoring
- Business logic implementation
- Coordinating multiple Codex tasks
- Final code review and integration

### Reasoning Effort Findings

| Level | Behavior | Use When |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `low` | Verbose, more tokens | Simple mechanical tasks |
| `medium` | Balanced (default) | Standard code generation |
| `high` | Thoughtful analysis | Code review, debugging |
| `xhigh` | Strategic, concise, fewer tokens | Architecture decisions |

### Token Costs (Tested)

| Task Type | Approximate Tokens |
|-----------|-------------------|
| File search | ~1.3k |
| Code comprehension | ~2.9k |
| Utility generation | ~3.5k |
| Security analysis | ~2.4-4.7k |
| Architecture design | ~1.6-4.7k |

### Codex Strengths (Observed)

- Uses `rg` efficiently for searches
- Proactively creates directories and updates exports
- Follows existing project conventions
- Good at isolated, well-scoped tasks
- Excellent security analysis capabilities

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Database operations
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://breeze:breeze@localhost:5432/breeze"
pnpm db:check-drift  # Verify schema matches migrations (no drift)
pnpm db:studio       # Open Drizzle Studio

# Agent development
cd agent && make run
```

### Schema Migration Workflow
1. Edit schema files in `apps/api/src/db/schema/`
2. Write a hand-written SQL migration in `apps/api/migrations/`. The runner accepts any filename matching `^\d{4}-.*\.sql$` and applies them in `localeCompare` (lexicographic) order, so the prefix has to sort correctly.
   - **Naming:** use `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.sql` (the current convention). The legacy `NNNN-<slug>.sql` 4-digit form is still accepted but only for files predating the date-prefix switch — don't introduce new ones.
   - **Same-day ordering:** if two migrations on the same date depend on each other (e.g. one creates a table, the other adds constraints or policies on it), insert an explicit `-a-`/`-b-` infix between the date and the slug: `2026-04-19-a-installer-bootstrap-tokens.sql`, `2026-04-19-b-installer-bootstrap-tokens-constraints.sql`. Don't rely on the slug to sort the files for you — `-` (0x2D) < `.` (0x2E), so `foo-bar.sql` sorts *after* `foo-bar-extra.sql`, which has bitten us before (issue #506). The `apps/api/src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts` regression test will catch most ordering bugs.
   - **Idempotent:** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` then re-add, `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION`, `pg_policies` existence checks for policies. Re-applying must be a no-op.
   - **No inner `BEGIN;`/`COMMIT;`:** `autoMigrate` wraps each file in `client.begin(...)`. Adding your own transaction blocks emits `NOTICE: there is already a transaction in progress` and serves no purpose.
   - **Cleanup statements must report row counts:** a migration that UPDATEs/DELETEs suspect rows (e.g. before adding a constraint) should wrap the statement in `DO $$ ... GET DIAGNOSTICS n = ROW_COUNT; IF n > 0 THEN RAISE WARNING 'cleaned % <what>', n; END IF; END $$;` so the count lands in Postgres logs. Silently fixing bad data destroys the forensic trail — if those rows could evidence a tenant-isolation breach, you want a recorded count even when it's 0 (lesson from `2026-06-10-c`).
   - **Never edit a shipped migration** — fix forward with a new migration. (Renaming is also editing for tracking purposes: `breeze_migrations` keys on filename, so a rename causes already-migrated DBs to re-apply under the new name. Only acceptable when the file is fully idempotent and re-application is a true no-op.)
3. Run `pnpm db:check-drift` to verify schema matches migrations
4. Commit the migration file

**Drizzle usage:** Drizzle ORM is used for type-safe queries only. `drizzle-kit` is retained for schema drift detection (`db:check-drift`) and Drizzle Studio (`db:studio`). **Do not use `drizzle-kit generate` or `drizzle-kit push` for migrations.**

For optional TimescaleDB setup, see `apps/api/migrations/optional/`.

### Docker Compose Modes

Three named override files exist — no auto-applied `docker-compose.override.yml` by default.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.override.yml.dev` | Code-mounted hot-reload (builds from `Dockerfile.api.dev` / `Dockerfile.web.dev`) |
| `docker-compose.override.yml.ghcr` | Pre-built GHCR images (linux/amd64) |
| `docker-compose.override.yml.local-build` | Native arm64 local build from production Dockerfiles |

```bash
# Dev mode (code-mounted, hot-reload)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.dev up --build -d

# GHCR mode (pre-built images)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.ghcr up -d

# Local build mode (native arm64)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.local-build up --build -d

# Do not create a root docker-compose.override.yml for shared commits;
# Docker Compose auto-loads that filename and can weaken production defaults.
#
# For local-only use, symlink whichever mode you want as default, but do not commit it:
# ln -sf docker-compose.override.yml.dev docker-compose.override.yml
# docker compose up --build -d
```

### PR Merge Process
- Branch protection requires status checks, but the repo owner uses `--admin` to bypass when CI is green
- Use `gh pr merge --squash --admin` (merge commits are disabled on this repo)
- This is the normal workflow — do not wait for branch protection rules to be satisfied

### GitHub Naming
- Do not use the `codex/` branch prefix for Breeze work. This applies even when Codex creates the branch or PR.
- Follow the existing GitHub branch patterns: `fix/<issue>-<short-slug>`, `feat/<issue>-<short-slug>`, `docs/<short-slug>`, `chore/<short-slug>`, `ops/<short-slug>`, `hotfix/<short-slug>`, or `integration/<short-slug>`.
- If there is no issue number, use the same prefix with a concise slug, e.g. `fix/<short-slug>` or `feat/<short-slug>`.
- Use `pr-####` or `pr-####-review` only when the branch is specifically for inspecting or reviewing an existing PR.
- Keep branch slugs lowercase, kebab-case, and specific to the work. Avoid agent/tool/vendor prefixes such as `codex/`, `claude/`, or similar.
- PR titles should follow the existing convention where useful: `fix(scope): summary`, `feat(scope): summary`, `docs(scope): summary`, or `chore(scope): summary`. Include the issue number as `(#1234)` when the work is tied to an issue.

### Linking Issues from a PR

The PR **body** decides whether the issue survives the merge. Pick deliberately —
this is not a stylistic choice.

- **`Closes #1234`** — the PR fully resolves the issue. Use this by default. The
  issue closes automatically on merge and leaves the backlog.
- **`Refs #1234`** — the PR resolves only part of the issue, or the issue is a
  community report whose reporter still has to verify on their own hardware. When
  you use `Refs`, **state in the PR body which half shipped and which did not** —
  a bare `Refs` with no scope note is how a fixed issue becomes permanent backlog.

`Refs` was the de-facto default for a long time and it does not close anything, so
~15 fully-fixed issues sat open for weeks (#2728, #2814, #2894, #2895, #2896, #2913,
#2950, #2974, #2997, #2999, #3000, #3006, #3201 among them). Default to `Closes`;
reach for `Refs` only when one of the two reasons above actually applies.

Mechanics: `Closes #X #Y` auto-closes **only** `#X`. Repeat the keyword per issue —
`Closes #X, closes #Y`.

### Production Deploy

Production hosts pull from `/opt/breeze` and use mutable image tags driven by `BREEZE_VERSION` in `/opt/breeze/.env`. Keep hostnames, regions, and internal mappings out of tracked files; use placeholders in docs and examples.

```bash
ssh root@<host> "cd /opt/breeze && \
  cp .env .env.bak-pre-<new-version> && \
  sed -i 's/^BREEZE_VERSION=.*/BREEZE_VERSION=<new-version>/' .env && \
  docker compose pull api web portal && \
  docker compose up -d binaries-init api web portal"
```

Then verify health with `curl -sf https://<host-or-domain>/health` (200 = healthy).

**The service list is hand-maintained and WILL go stale — always assert version parity after deploying.** Services are named explicitly (not a bare `docker compose pull && up -d`) because the billing service builds from a local image with no registry to pull from, and a bare `up -d` would needlessly bounce the reverse proxy, redis and the tunnel. The cost is that a newly added first-party service is silently never rolled — the customer portal (a separate container serving `/portal/*`, which customers reach from quote and invite emails) stayed several versions behind for weeks while `/health` reported the new version. Watchtower is not a backstop: it is label-gated and no service carries the label.

`/health` is served by the API and cannot detect this, so enumerate what is actually running:

```bash
ssh root@<host> "cd /opt/breeze && set -a && . ./.env && set +a && \
  docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}' | grep 'ghcr.io/lanternops/breeze/' | \
  while IFS=\$'\t' read -r n i; do t=\${i##*:}; \
    [ \"\$t\" = \"\$BREEZE_VERSION\" ] && echo \"OK    \$n \$t\" || echo \"SKEW  \$n \$t (expected \$BREEZE_VERSION)\"; done"
# every line must be OK; any SKEW means that service was never rolled.
```

**Required env vars added by v0.65+ — production hosts without these refuse to start:**

- `RELEASE_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEYS` — base64 SPKI of the Ed25519 release manifest signing key. Source: `internal/release-keys/release-manifest.ed25519.pub` (the base64 between `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`, single line). The API config validator refuses to boot in production without it when `BINARY_SOURCE=github`.
- `IS_HOSTED` — must be explicitly set to `true` (hosted SaaS) or `false` (self-hosted) in production. Without this, a misconfigured deploy (e.g. `.env` value not mapped through compose) silently drops new partners straight to `status='active'`, bypassing the email-verification gate in `/auth/register-partner` (issue #570).

When introducing a new required env var: add it to `/opt/breeze/.env` AND map it explicitly in the `api`/`web` service `environment:` block of `/opt/breeze/docker-compose.yml`. Compose interpolation only happens for vars listed there — having a value in `.env` is necessary but not sufficient.

**Watchtower policy (#603):** repo-tracked compose files never include Watchtower (enforced by `check-supply-chain-hardening.sh`). On production hosts, Watchtower is acceptable for sidecars (caddy, redis, postgres-exporter, cloudflared) but **must not** auto-update `breeze-api` or `breeze-web`. Concretely, the `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable: "true"` label is forbidden on those two services. The hardening check additionally rejects that label string in any tracked compose file as defense-in-depth.

**Known drift:** the deployed `/opt/breeze/docker-compose.yml` may use Watchtower + mutable tags, while `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` in the repo uses digest-pinning + no Watchtower. The `check-supply-chain-hardening.sh` rule scans repo files only, so host drift isn't fully enforced. Reconciling this is tracked separately.
