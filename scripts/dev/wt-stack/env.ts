  // #6447 — this stack exists to be driven by Playwright, and a Playwright run
  // is structurally indistinguishable from the runaway clients the API's rate
  // limiters exist to stop:
  //
  //  - `globalSetup` mints ONE storageState, so every context in the run —
  //    across all workers — replays the same refresh cookie and therefore
  //    shares a single refresh-token FAMILY. `POST /auth/refresh` is budgeted
  //    per family (60/60s, `getRefreshRateLimit()`), and `apps/web` is an Astro
  //    MPA that spends one refresh on EVERY full-page navigation. Four workers
  //    navigating concurrently blow 60 navigations a minute in seconds; the API
  //    429s, and the web app masks itself with "Too many requests —
  //    reconnecting. Retrying in 32s…" (AuthThrottledMask) or, once the access
  //    token is gone, bounces to "Your session expired". That is exactly how
  //    the portal-dev-e2e CI job went red on every PR the day a fourth,
  //    navigation-heavy spec joined its list.
  //  - Every request reaches the API through Caddy, so the global per-IP
  //    limiter (300/min, `middleware/globalRateLimit.ts`) sees the whole run as
  //    ONE client. Per-IP budgeting is meaningless on a single-tenant dev stack
  //    and only meters the suite against itself.
  //
  // `E2E_MODE` is the API's own switch for both. Its blast radius is WIDER than
  // those two limiters, and all of it is intended here — grep the flag before
  // assuming this list is complete:
  //
  //  - `middleware/globalRateLimit.ts` — global per-IP limiter off.
  //  - `routes/auth/login.ts` — BOTH the per-family refresh limiter and the
  //    per-IP/per-email login limiter off.
  //  - `services/jwt.ts` — access token 15m → 24h, refresh 7d → 30d, viewer
  //    2h → 24h. Welcome here: a longer access token is fewer refreshes, which
  //    is the pressure this whole block is about.
  //  - `routes/auth/helpers.ts` — the 350 ms auth-response timing floor off,
  //    so pre-auth endpoints answer at full speed.
  //
  // What it does NOT unlock here is the auth-transition test barrier
  // (`routes/auth/authTransitionTestBarrier.ts`): that additionally requires
  // NODE_ENV=test plus a 32-char secret, and this stack runs NODE_ENV
  // development (docker-compose.override.yml.dev / .worktree) with no such
  // secret. `config/validate.ts` refuses the flag outright under NODE_ENV
  // production, so a stack carrying it structurally cannot be a production one.
  //
  // The sibling auth-browser-transition CI job already sets it; pinning it in
  // the stack itself fixes local `wt-stack test` runs the same way.
  //
  // `e2e-tests/test-helpers.ts`'s `clearRefreshState` remains as a belt-and-
  // braces reset for a stack brought up without this, but it only fires between
  // tests and so cannot refill the budget inside one long-running test.
